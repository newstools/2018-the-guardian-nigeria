Bamisaye, who was the Director of Finance in Ise-Orun Local Government Area, Ise-Ekiti, jumped into the well in his compound behind Tinuola Maximum School, off Afao Road, Ado-Ekiti. The deceased had earlier drink water mixed with cement in an earlier attempt to kill himself before jumping into the well. Top management staff of local governments in the state have being paying condolence visit to Bamisaye’s home. Sympathizers have also been trooping to his residence to commiserate with the widow and other members of the family. Activities were said to have been grounded at Ise-Orun Local Government secretariat when the report of Bamisaye’s death filtered in. The cause of the suicide could not be immediately ascertained. Bamisaye is the third senior management staff that would die in Ise-Orun Local Government Area this year as two other directors had died before him in mysterious circumstances. A source told newsmen: “The deceased woke up at about 4:00a.m. to assist his wife do some house chores and even called some council workers he used to convey to Ise everyday to be ready to join him to their station. “All of a sudden, he disappeared and went outside with the wife looking for her. Later she discovered that the well was opened and they saw his body floating. “The wife and other people who joined her in searching for the deceased later saw the cement he had mixed with water, which he might have taken before taking the plunge into the well. The men of the State Fire Service had come to remove the body, which has since been deposited at the mortuary.” The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Mr. Caleb Ikechukwu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, was not available for comment as his phone was switched off.
