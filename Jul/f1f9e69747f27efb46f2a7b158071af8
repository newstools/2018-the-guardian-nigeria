 Ladipo Market  Nwankwo made the appeal at the weekend during the election of new executives of the Aguiyi Ironsi International market in Ladipo by the traders. Over 3,000 accredited traders took part in the election, which was supervised by operatives of the market’s electoral committee, the police, Department of State Services (DSS), and officials from Mushin Local Government Area. According to Nwankwo, the market leaders ensured a transparent, free and fair process in order to avoid post-election violence. He said his concern was for anyone who emerged winner to sustain the peace which was restored by the out-gone chairman, Onyemaechi, adding that the chairman should also ensure there was good road and sanitary systems in the market. Similarly, the Area D Police Commander, Mushin, Olasoji Akinbayo, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), said his men and other security agencies averted breakdown of law and order, which usually rear its ugly head during the election. He said measures were taken to prevent arms smuggling into the voting area, adding that from the electoral process, he did not envisage any post-election violence. The Special Adviser to the Mushin Local Government chairman on Politics, Babatunde Kehinde, debunked rumours that his boss, Emmanuel Gbamigboye, sponsored a preferred candidate, insisting that the council was only interested in having a transparent process that would enthrone a leader chosen by the people. “He is only interested in the peaceful conduct of the election. He will work with whoever emerges for the progress of the market. We had issues of revenue remittance and environmental challenges in the past.” Onyemaechi also expressed confidence in the process, urging anyone who succeeds him to improve on his administration’s good policies and discard those that were bad.
