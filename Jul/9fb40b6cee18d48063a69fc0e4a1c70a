Is Ciara back to claim the crown? Returning with her first single since 2015,  32 years old singer, Ciara has released a new song titled “Level Up” with a music video for the track. The song starts with the words “Okay, remember what I told you; Be your own boss. Love yourself. Get up and dance”. Collaborating with Parris Goebel to create the video, we see Ciara and a cast of backup dancers dancing to the high energy beat in a sparse room. After going through her lowest moments as a single mother to Future’s baby, the singer shared a post on Instagram in January which got her a lot of backlash from fans after telling women to “level up” in marriages. She eventually had to post a follow-up message explaining he message to fans. #LevelUp. Don’t Settle. A post shared by  Ciara (@ciara) on Jan 20, 2018 at 7:17am PST
