School’s out, and millions of students around the world wonder what they will do with all their free time. There are games to play, movies to watch and friends to hang out with. But there are also plenty of productive things to do this summer holiday. Here are some options to consider if you don’t have summer activities lined up already: Learning a skill has been undervalued in more ways than you can think of. But the truth is learning a skill is very necessary. It adds more value to you. You could learn skills like public speaking, cooking, drawing, self-defence or negotiation. You never know when you might use it. A volunteer, Photo; A Great Way To Work Finding a practical way to serve and contribute to society is a productive and fun way to spend your summer. You could volunteer to clean up the environment, help out at a nursing home or work at an orphanage. You don’t have to worry about learning a language perfectly; the basics are just enough. That way, you can never get missing in a foreign country. You can learn a new language using Duolingo, Babbel or BBC Languages. Your priority shouldn’t be what the pay will be. As the saying goes, “Take a job for what you will learn, not for what you will earn.” This is especially true when it comes to school holiday jobs. The best learning experience might just come in the form of an unpaid job or internship. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-704980 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Writing-Photo-Warsheek.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="876" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Writing-Photo-Warsheek.jpg 450w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Writing-Photo-Warsheek-274x240.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Writing skills are important for academic and career success.
