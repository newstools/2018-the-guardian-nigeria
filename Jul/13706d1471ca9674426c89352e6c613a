It was a crazy moment, they were delighted. Then they suddenly realised that I was underneath them,” said Mexico City-based Cortez. Quick as a flash, he picked up his camera and took some remarkable close-up shots of the Croats’ joy. “Then they asked me if I was OK. Another one picked up my lens and another player (Domagoj Vida) gave me a kiss.” Croatia, who have reached the final for the first time in their history, will play France on Sunday.
