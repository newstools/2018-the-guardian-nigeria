The Commission said all vehicles conveying “sensitive materials for distribution to 16 LGAs” in the state for the election are being tracked “o locations real-time from departure, en route and arrival” to prevent diversion of the materials. It said the tracking of the vehicles was an innovation to further strengthened the integrity of the outcome of the election, which is billed to be a two-horse race between All Progressives Congress and People’s Democratic Party.
