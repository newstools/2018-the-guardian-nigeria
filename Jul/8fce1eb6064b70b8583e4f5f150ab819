 Naomi Osemudua  The conference with the theme, ‘Your Story is your Gift’ will hold on Friday, August 24 and Saturday August 25 in Lagos. According to the convener, Naomi Osemudua, “This movement will welcome over 1000 women from different parts of the world to an electrifying and life-changing programme designed to empower women to embrace their stories, find their cure and profit from it. “We believe that every woman can change their narrative through storytelling and the platform is targeted at helping them identify limiting and self – sabotaging beliefs stopping them from living their best lives while drawing inspiration and lessons from influential women around the world who are confirmed to speak.” Some of Speakers billed for the event include, Desiree Lee – a convicted felon who shares her prison experience and hardships as a convicted felon with teens and parent; Eryca Freemantle a transformational life coach who through a near-fatal road traffic accident that left her with facial scarring and total hair loss, has spurred her on to create her own solutions to the problems women of different skin tones experience. Others are Hauwa Ojeifor, founder of the support group She Writes Woman, which focuses on mental health support and outreach for the most vulnerable people in the community; Lepacious Bose, who is considered to be one of the most prominent Nigeria comedian actors, shares her story about weight loss, self-esteem and getting her confidence back.
