He stressed that the yearly Lagos Architects Forum has been rebranded and redefined with a broadened content, thereby witnessing significant increase in exhibitors evidenced by the sale of 98 per cent of available booths, 2,500 registered participants and inevitable increase in revenue at the last edition. Also, the chapter has planned a pilot scheme for debt recovery for full members.The debt recovery scheme followed a proposal made by the chairman of the Practice Committee at the March 2017 meeting. Under the scheme, two highly recommended law firms were to be hired on a retainer basis on behalf of full members and legal matters.Although details of offsetting this additional financial burden are yet to be finalised, The Guardian learnt that under the proposed scheme, members so affected in a case of a defaulting client, should have recourse to the chapter first, while the chapter should try all legitimate means to resolve the matter amicably, failing which the matter may be referred to the law firms for their attention.This was contained in a report complied by the chairman of Practice Committee of the chapter, Ifeoma George –Ufot, which was presented at the event.
