Security operatives allegedly drafted from the Nigeria Police Force and Department of State Services (DSS) Tuesday chased out workers from their offices at the Benue State House of Assembly complex including the Clerk of the House, Torese Agena. Agena told newsmen shortly after they were locked out of the complex, pointing out that the security operatives stormed the Assembly complex without any prior notice and asked all staff to leave the premises. “Today, staffs of the Assembly were after two hours of resumption of work, asked to vacate the Assembly. The security personnel said they were acting on orders given to them by the Police Commissioner, Besan Gwana,” the clerk said. “This is one harassment too many. I, therefore, urge President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on the Inspector General of Police to withdraw his men from the Assembly so that staff can carry out their duties unhindered. Eight lawmakers had on Monday served an impeachment notice on Governor Samuel Ortom. The eight have also taken over the premises of the assembly while police maintained a huge presence outside. The impeachment plot is reportedly being coordinated by Terkimbi Ikyange who was removed as speaker of the assembly last week.
