The Venture Garden Group, GreenHouse Capital, has opened 2018 application for the first-female-focused tech accelerator program in Nigeria.  The three-month accelerator programme begins mid-August and will run through mid-November. According to the Director of GreenHouse Lab, Tosin Durotoye: “To tap into the vast   brainpower  and  opportunity   for innovation   necessary   to   propel   Nigeria   and   Africa   as  a  whole  forward, our  mission  at GreenHouse Lab  is  to  level the  playing  field  by  providing  early‑stage, women-led,  high‑ growth  technology  start‑ups  with investments  and support  infrastructure within  the  range  of  250, 000  USD. “We also provide exceptional teams with the resources and mentorship	 network they need to  drive  growth  and  scale  their companies  both  in  emerging  and  international  markets.” Durotoye noted that the program is residential and will be hosted at Vibranium Valley tech campus in Lagos.  The accelerator ends with a demo day where companies get to pitch their businesses to a wider network of local and international investors. In a research conducted by Disrupt Africa, $195.1 million in venture capital funding was invested in African start‑ups compared to $129.1million in 2016, an increase of 51 per cent. With $63.3 million in startup investments in 2017, Nigeria was the top investment destination in Africa followed by South Africa and Kenya.  As Nigeria continues to emerge as a technology hub, one thing is clear, women are missing on the playing field. The research further revealed that of the 25 per cent of women in tech, only 21 per cent are tech executives and of these, only 11 per cent are African technology officers.  Currently, more than half of global executives report a shortfall of tech workers, which slows or prevents businesses from growing. “In addition to being under-represented in   the tech space, women are also severely under-funded.  In  2017, women-led start-ups received just 2.2 per cent of all available venture capital dollars although women-led startups have been found to produce over 30 per cent higher return on equity.” The first-of-its-kind in Nigeria, GreenHouse Lab is a three-month   accelerator focused solely on early stage, women-led technology start-ups in sub‑Saharan Africa,  as well as African-run  startups  domiciled  in  the  US  or  UK  with  products  that  are  scalable  in  African  markets. GreenHouse Capital will also invest a minimum of 100, 000 USD in companies that qualify and reach specific milestones at the end of the program.
