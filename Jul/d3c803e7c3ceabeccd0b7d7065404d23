Many African governments were accused of repressing free press. Deodatus Balile from the Tanzania Editors Forum; Barbara Kaija, Editor-in-Chief, Uganda’s New Vision newspaper; and Joan Chirwa, Editor-in-Chief, Zambia’s The Mast newspaper deliberated on why this is so. At this point, I made a case for why local journalists in Africa should be assisted by international organisations like IPI to overcome many dangers being faced on the job.

The don offered a strong defence for press freedom, while expressing deep concerns over attempts to criminalise hate speech in the country without being able to clearly define what it is, saying such a move cannot become a reality. However, the night did not end without colourful dance performances by the AfriTheatre Group and others.

Khadija Sharife, OCCRP’s Africa editor, stressed that poorly-paid journalists were easy targets, calling on media organisations to always pay their journalists well, just as I equally advised participants not to neglect the non-oil industry in their reportage because of the many unreported illegalities taking place across Africa.

They further called on African governments to protect the safety of journalists and repeal anti-media laws, among others. The general assembly elected four new Executive Board members and re-elected three including Khadija Patel, as IPI Vice-Chair while the board appointed John Daniszewski, Associated Press, as Vice-President for standards and Editor-at-Large, as IPI’s special representative for journalist safety. An exciting and lively closing dinner was hosted by the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and Chairman, IPI Nigeria/Chairman, Daily Trust Nigeria, Kabiru Yusuf, who expressed his profound appreciation to all for the well-attended congress while Saraki urged media practitioners to be objective in their reportage in the build-up to the nation’s general elections. As participants were at their great moments, Markus Spillmann, former Editor-in-Chief, Switzerland’s Neue Zrcher Zeitung, was named as the 34th chair of IPI, as he takes over from John Yearwood, former World Editor, Miami Herald, having served out two terms. Before Barbara Trionfi left for Vienna, Austria; base of IPI, both of us were invited to the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) national headquarters on Good Morning Nigeria, anchored by Claire Adelabu Abdulrazak, where fragmentation of the media, proliferation, fake news, press freedom and the like were discussed. Meanwhile, some months ago, Barbara had visited Nigeria, where she met with top government functionaries and media executives on the congress, which had Nduka Obaigbena, President, Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN)/Publisher, This Day newspapers as its Chairman, Local Organising Committee; while the Secretary of IPI Nigeria, Raheem Adedoyin, was Secretary while different planning committees were set up in Nigeria, after last year’s congress, held in Hamburg, Germany. No doubt, the congress has come and gone, but the thought-provoking discussions were deep, robust and highly resourceful. It is only hoped all the stakeholders at the Abuja congress would ensure that good journalism truly matters towards a strong and healthy society.
