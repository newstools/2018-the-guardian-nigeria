He implored the APC to stop meddling in PDP affairs and face what is left of its disintegrated structure.He described the action as a distraction, and asked its members not to fall for the antics of APC, but work towards ensuring victory for the party. But the APC has denied any meddling in the PDP affairs, and urged the party to face its internal problem.Odeyemi insisted: “We can’t afford to miss this opportunity to wrestle Osun State from the grip of the failing APC. We have it on good authority that the APC has been going about looking for willing hands within our fold to use against us. “I urge our members to reject any offer from APC against the collective good of our party.
