Yuwe visits her fiance as usual on the only day they get to spend time together in the week. As they are accustomed to, they share gentle kisses in the middle of the conversation and it evolves into something more heated.

He only lets go of her when he is satisfied. She is still crying when he turns to her, recoiling when he makes to touch her. “Why?” he asks. “You raped me,” she screams. Raped?
