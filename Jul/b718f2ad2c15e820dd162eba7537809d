 Mr Terkimbi Ikyange  He was suspended for allegedly underestimating the house rules. The impeached Speaker was alleged to have mobilized men of Nigeria Police Force to deny lawmakers access to the Assembly complex. The lawmakers eventually held the Friday plenary at the old banquet hall of the Benue State Government House Makurdi. The Majority Leader, Avine Agbom, however, moved the motion to suspend Ikyange which was backed by 18 other lawmakers. Ikyange had rejected his impeachment declaring the process illegal with claims that his impeachment did not go through the legislative procedures. The motion for Ikyange’s impeachment was moved by Richard Ujege (APC) of Konshisha constituency and seconded by Anthony Ogbu (APC) of Ado constituency. Ujege cited the alleged highhandedness of the former Speaker as reasons for his and other officers’ ouster. Ikyangbe has since then replaced by Titus Ugba of Kyan constituency.
