Nigeria is one of the over 170 countries taking part in first ever Special Olympics Unified Cup, which commences today in Chicago, USA to mark its 50th anniversary. The sporting fiesta is sponsored by Toyota. The tournament, which features 24 teams comprising eight for women and 16 men’s teams, with and without intellectual disabilities athletes around the world, will hold alongside other events lined-up for the weeklong event. The Special Olympics Nigeria male unified football team is the continent’s sole representative in the inaugural edition. Exxon Mobil Nigeria, a strong supporter of inclusion, is said to have contributed towards the purchase and branding of the team’s kit and travel attires for the fiesta. Exxon Mobil Foundation has also displayed its support for inclusion through the Skillz for Life programme, where people with and without intellectual disabilities are given quality health education on malaria and HIV/AIDS and taught life skills. In 2016, Exxon Mobil sponsored the Youth Empowerment Initiatives where athletes were empowered with skills such as, photography, beadwork and more. In tomorrow’s opening day, Special Olympics will honour its history and celebrate its future with the lighting of the Special Olympics Eternal Flame of Hope monument outside Soldier Field, home of the first games, to symbolise the ongoing mission of inclusion.
