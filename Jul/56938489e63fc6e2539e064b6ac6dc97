 The ACF wants to unearth and develop cyclists from schools to international stardom.  The competition is aimed at encouraging safe and regular cycling among secondary school students, male and female, across Nigeria.The founder of ACF, Mr. Yemi Osilaja said the SCC is a platform for teenagers to exhibit their cycling skills and encourage more teens to take up safe and regular cycling in order to grow into healthy adults with long life expectancy. “The goal of the SCC is to facilitate the establishment of cycling clubs in secondary schools.” According to him, though it is free to participate, registration can only be done through a participating school, and all competitors must be part of the school team and presented by the school. He added that ACF would provide all bicycles and helmets for the competition, while the competition is targeted at secondary school students in rural and semi-urban areas who have to trek long distances to and from school daily. Osilaja disclosed that the cycling challenge is in collaboration with relevant educational authorities, community leaders, gatekeepers, school authorities and parents cum guardians to ensure a smooth and credible process. He added that the foundation was willing to partner with individuals and corporate organisations to make the competition a huge success. He said, “Sponsorship is welcome from individuals and corporate organizations. Sponsors’ brands would feature prominently on all competition media and publicity materials. We seek to partner with corporate organizations to establish cycling clubs for their staff. We are involved in a robust advocacy for the development of an enabling environment for safe and regular cycling at all levels in Nigeria.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
