It showed a photo of captain Luka Modric who was awarded the Golden Ball for the best player at the tournament, holding a trophy, although with a sad face after the defeat. “Brave hearts – You made us proud,” said Jutarnji List daily. “Croatia celebrates you, you are our gold!” echoed the Vecernji List. It noted that for the past month coach Zlatko Dalic’s team “made Croatia better”. “They restored pride, pulled it out of the pessimism” reigning in the country whose economy remains among the weakest in the European Union.
