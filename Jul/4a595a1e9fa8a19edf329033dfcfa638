 Augustine Equavoen  Eguavoen, who led the Super Eagles to Egypt 2006 AFCON, where Nigeria finished third, noted that the warring parties in the NFF leadership tussle should not allow the crises to destabilize football activities in any capacity. He stressed that players not participating in the league would put Nigeria football development in jeopardy. Equavoen charged the LMC to put their house together for the league to function. He added that the Super Eagles coaches should at this point start sourcing for younger players to be injected into the U-17 and U-20 teams. “Players need to be continuously active to be at their best,” Eguavoen said. “The suspension of the League is not a good omen for a country. With the current crises in the NFF, there is no way football can develop. The issue every body need to focus on now is how to get things right after the Super Eagles early exit from the World Cup.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
