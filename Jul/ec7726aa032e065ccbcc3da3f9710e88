He was later traced and arrested and made some useful statement to the police.
 
Meanwhile, the Lagos State Central Business Districts enforcement unit has uncovered another criminal hideout, suspected to be a ritual den. The spot is under the bridge located at the back of Onikan stadium, when descending the Army flag House close to the Governor’s House, Marina, Lagos.
 
The Special Adviser to the governor on Central Business Districts, Mr. Olarenwaju Elegushi, said the hideout similar to previous criminal and ritualist hideouts discovered in various parts of the state some months ago by security operatives was uncovered while carrying out the governor’s directives to clear the area of debris and refuse, which had accumulated under the bridge. The Special Adviser, however, said no arrest was made, but items like charms and dangerous weapons were discovered and cleared from the place. He said police authority and armed force settlement close to the area had been notified of the discovery for necessary action. He disclosed that the Office of the Special Adviser on CBD would leave no stone unturned to dislodge criminals in any hideout on the island to make the Lagos Island business district safe for business transactions and leisure.
