Out of the six Southwest states of Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Oyo state, three winners will represent the region at the national finals slated for September in Abuja. The representatives who emerged from an earlier competition organised for all secondary schools in the zone contested for the opportunity at the Wesley School of Science, Elekuro, Ibadan. At the end of the keenly contested competition, Lagos, Ogun and Osun states emerged first with 55 points, Oyo and Ekiti states emerged fourth with 50 points apiece while Ondo state emerged sixth with 40 points. The leading students are Emmanuel Igban from The Ambassadors College, Ota, Ogun State; Franklin Ekere from Meiran Community Senior High School, Lagos and Owoseni Oreoluwa from Destiny International College, Osogbo, Osun State. With the result, Lagos, Ogun and Osun states will represent the southwest region at the national finals in Abuja. The quiz question as set by the West African Examination Council (WAEC), covers Biology, Chemistry, English Language, Mathematics and Physics. The regional final had in attendance the Oyo State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Prof. Adeniyi Olowofela, the Permanent Secretary of the ministry as well as NNPC officials. The Commissioner who commended the NNPC for the initiative seized the opportunity to appeal for the support of the corporation in the new ICT drive of the state government. While expressing optimism that the measure, if sustained will help promote the study and knowledge of sciences by the youths, Olowofela reiterated the commitment of the government to improve the study of sciences and technology across secondary schools in the state. He said, â€œWhat we are witnessing today is one of the efforts of the NNPC. Experience has shown that many of the winners in time past are successful people today. Not only in the quiz competition like this, they also support sporting competition and agriculture, so, we are also calling on them to support us in our recent ICT drive for schools.
