The national airline is named Nigeria Air. The unveiling was done at Farnborough Air Show in London. The airshow is the meeting place where aircraft manufacturers, engine manufacturers, aircraft leasing companies, aviation consultants and marketers gather every two years to do business. “The new national carrier will bring Nigeria closer to the world,” the presidency said. The Minister of State for Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika during the conference said “It is a business, not a social service. Government will not be involved in running it or deciding who runs it. The investors will have full responsibility for this.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
