 Osun state  Oyetola, who is Gov. Rauf Aregbesola’s Chief of Staff, made the appeal on Sunday while addressing his supporters in Obokun area of the state. He said it was disheartening that some ‘ desperate politicians’ were already  distributing money to the electorate ahead of the election. Oyetola, however, advised voters  to shun such monetary inducement. According to him, collecting such money is  mortgaging their children’s future. Oyetola said he was contesting the election in order to consolidate on Aregbesola’s achievements. The governorship aspirant said he would banish hunger, poverty and unemployment as well as revatilise the health sector. He also pledged to  promote functional education while enhancing  communal peace and progress in the state.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
