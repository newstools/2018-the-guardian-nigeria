 Yinka Odumakin  Afenifere’s spokesman, Yinka Odumakin, said this in a statement yesterday. The group condemned the deployment of 30,000 police personnel for election in one state, while the government cannot mobilise a quarter of that to secure the lives of Nigerians who are under severe attacks in different parts of the country. According to the group: “Reports from the media have indicated that the violence in Ekiti is being precipitated by the police who were said to have sealed off the Government House and shot teargas at citizens who have broken no laws. “There has also been a sacrilegious allegation that the governor of the state was assaulted and teargased. This would be an outrageous and barbaric assault that violates all decency and civilised conducts, if true.” Afenifere called on President Muhammadu Buhari to rise to the duty of his office to stop the violence, and bring perpetrators of the dastardly act to book. “It speaks no well of him that security forces are turning the state to a battleground 24 hours after he campaigned there.” Also, Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Southwest zone, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, said what happened in Ekiti yesterday was an indication of what Nigeria would face in 2019.
