“I hope someone somewhere will be able to draw inspiration from me. Considering what I’ve been through and how I have been able to overcome that, and still live a positive life, doing positive things…” I made an open call on Twitter and asked people to get the word out, but it was difficult finding people who wanted to share their stories. But not Edwin! Victor Ugo of Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) introduced him to me and he was nothing but positive about the series from the jump. Many months after that email and shoot, Edwin still radiates so much energy that it is impossible to meet him and not be overwhelmed by great feelings. Asides his occupation as a Food Scientist, he also shared that he loves to drive and works on an online taxi service. He get’s so many stares from riders he picks and people who see him beside his car but that hasn’t stopped him.  Edwin is so vibrant and full of life! His driving incident cost him his arm, but it definitely didn’t cost him his outlook on life and that’s why his story is so inspiring. He is a classic example of making lemonades out of lemons. The I AM series is an on-going series by Chidera Muoka in collaboration with Niyi Okeowo to showcase unique individuals who are plus-size, have tribal marks, or have physical scars. To capture them in their most vulnerable form and share their amazing stories.
