 Alhaji Lateef Jakande  On the other hand, visionary leadership theory rose to prominence in 1980-90s, and can be traced back to the political sociology writings of Max Weber and James Macgregor Burns. Visionary leadership molds have a twin focal point on who a leader is as well as what a leader does, merging both the trait and behavioural theories of leadership.  They also have a willingness to take personal risks and make sacrifices in order to realise their vision. They anticipate change and are proactive, rather than reactive to events. They focus on opportunities, not on problems. They have a winning mentality and will never rationalise failure. A real visionary leader accomplishes great feats by drawing on innate inner strength and as such is not often moved by external obstacles. In Nigeria, Lagos State is commonly regarded as the nation’s Center of Excellence. Truly, in terms of its socio-economic uniqueness, Lagos remains a trendsetter in Nigeria. It accounts for over 60% of Nigeria’s industrial and commercial activities; 70% of national maritime cargo freight, over 80% of international aviation traffic and over 50% of Nigeria’s energy consumption. The two seaports in Lagos account for 70% of the sea trade in the country. However, in as much as Lagos socio-economic indices are plausibly mind-blowing, it is actually the quality of its political leadership that has really defined the state of aquatic splendour. Since its creation in 1967, Lagos State has been blessed with visionary leaders whose vision and thoughts have molded the state to the path of sustained greatness. One of such leaders is Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande, popularly referred to as LKJ, the state’s first democratically elected governor. One of the golden eras in the socio-political evolution of Lagos State was, without a doubt, between October 1, 1979 and December 31, 1983 when LKJ held sway as governor. From the outset, he had clearly promised to give Lagos a purposeful leadership. Upon inauguration, LKJ pledged to model his government after that of the defunct Western Region of Nigeria, from 1952 to 1959, headed by Chief Obafemi Awolowo. He said: That government was the most efficient, the most dynamic, and the most responsive of all the governments of the federation. That government was the country’s pacesetter- the first to do all good things that others later copied. There has never been a government like it in Africa before or since.
 
True to his words, LKJ assiduously went to work to realise his vision. There is hardly any sector that the magical hands of this visionary leader did not transform. LKJ simply took governance to an un-imaginable height in Lagos State. Till date, many of his populist policies and programmes, especially in the housing, public transportation and education sectors, still endear him to all and sundry.
 
His passion for the development of Lagos State knows no bound. The ambitious Lagos metro line project, which, if it had seen the light of the day, would have revolutionised public transportation in the state, was conceived by his administration. Till date, some of the Housing Estates he established across various locations such as Iba, Isolo, Iponri, Ejigbo etc, are still serving the housing needs of Lagosians.  
 
It was under his administration that movement into state’s current Secretariat at Alausa, Ikeja, began. Â LKJ reportedly attached so much urgency to the construction of the present government secretariat that he was so bent on the relocation plan that he virtually caught everyone unawares when it finally happened. According to him, if it was not done when it took place, there would be no appropriate time to do so. So, the State holds the present secretariat’s vision to him.
  
Being a consummate journalist, and following the trend of his political mentor, Chief Obafemi Awolowo who established the first television station in Africa, the defunct Western Nigeria Television Station (now Nigeria Television Authority), LKJ also  established Lagos Television, LTV, which happens to be the first state owned television in the country. Aside this, LKJ also established the Lagos State University in 1983 for the advancement of learning and establishment of academic excellence in Lagos State. His administration also constructed water works at Shasha, Agege, Somolu, Apapa, Badagry, Aguda etc to improve water supply and avoid outbreak of water borne epidemics.
 
A workaholic and tireless leader, LKJ worked round the clock in his bid to fast track the development of Lagos State. Reports had it that on December 31st, 1983, when the Shehu Shagari civilian administration was toppled, in a military coup d’tat, soldiers who came to arrest LKJ met him at his office working deep in the night, on a New Year eve. Such was his legendary dedication to duty and passion for hard work. Ogunbiyi wrote from Lagos State Ministry of Information and Strategy, Alausa, Ikeja.
