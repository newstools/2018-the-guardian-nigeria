Osun State governor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has praised the direct primary system of candidate selection adopted by the All Progressive Congress (APC) for electing Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola from Iragbiji as flag bearer.
 
Governor Aregbesola, who spoke in Osogbo, yesterday, while reacting to the outcome of the primary noted that the massive turnout by party faithful, its peaceful conduct devoid of rancor and violence, have vindicated the party and its option for direct primary.
 
He said the direct primary option had made all eligible APC members to be the real electors and true joint owners of the party governorship ticket, adding that he would proudly recommend it to the party at the national level, to other political parties and other states in the country.
 
While stressing that all true lovers of party democracy should commend the Osun APC for the use of direct primary, the governor added: “In the light of the violence, irregularities, huge complaints and massive dis-enfranchisement that accompanied the delegate system adopted in most states, this system is better.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
