Paul Adefarasin, the general overseer of House On The Rock, has come under attack for using his platform to voice against the invasion of the herdsmen who are allegedly responsible for the death of Nigerians. Addressing his congregation, the pastor said: “we see no python dance, it is evidently a land grab by the Fulanis” while alleging that a “Mahdi” is responsible for it. Recall that the Guardian reported that the presidency recommended that the nation prays as they have tried their best with security.

May the God we ALL serve EXPOSE the hearts of men who incite enimity. The call to every follower of Christ is to pursue peace with ALL men. Guess some read the Bible wrong. https://t.co/gPcGeyX3zH — ilsa aida (@IlsaAida) July 1, 2018      Some beg to differ:
