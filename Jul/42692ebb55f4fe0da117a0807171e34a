 PVC  The electorate alleged that they had been visiting the office for several months without getting their PVC’s. He described it as false and one coming from aggrieved electorates who merely wish to say anything offensive in anger. One of the protesters from Oye Ekiti, Sola Akindele, who transferred his card to Ado, said: “Last week, I was here for the PVC and they asked me to come today, and I have been coming, but we can’t get the cards. “They are even using the police to harass us, but we won’t accept this,” he said. Reacting, Public Relations Officer of INEC in Ekiti, Taiwo Gbadegesin denied the allegation that INEC sold the PVCs to politicians. He described it as false and one coming from aggrieved electorates who merely wish to say anything offensive in anger. He said: “We have just taken delivery of the final copies of the PVCs and we need to do some sorting to respective offices of the commission in the various local governments. We cannot just begin to give them out like that. “We need to know which one goes to this or that poling units. All prospective voters that have duly registered will get their cards this week unfailingly. We urge them to exercise patient. “The allegation that we have sold the PVCs can’t be true, because it is not possible for another person to use one’s PVCs.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
