At the inception of Nollywood in the early 1990’s, there were many budding actors and actresses that dominated the screen. They rose to stardom and became household names. Corporate organisations went after them, using them as brand ambassadors to advertise their products and services. They became rich and influential in the society. Suddenly, their faces disappeared from the screen, not because they have retired, but were dislodged by new faces in the industry. These new faces are younger, talented and daring. They are making waves and because age is on their side, many believe that the sky is their starting point. But who are these faces? In continuation of The Guardian cover story of May 12 titled ‘Searching for Nollywood Stars Of Yesteryears’, the new faces of Nollywood are hereby presented… Mercy Mac Joe
Mercy Mac Joe once told the story of how she flogged the street hawking to make ends meet. But the story is different today, as she has hugged the soapbox. An up and coming actress, Mary is a native of Eket in Akwa-Ibom state. The friendly and amiable actress joined the industry in 2011 and she has since then been working her way steadily up the ladder. ‘Crown Queen’, ‘Mad House’, ‘Blackberry Babes’, ‘The Lonely Princess’’ are some of the movies in her expanding movie pouch. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-691958 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="721" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-640x361.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-974x549.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bisola-aiyeola-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />Bisola Aiyeola
