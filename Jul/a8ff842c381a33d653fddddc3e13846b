Macron is on a visit to Nigeria where he met President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja and also paid a visit to Afrika Shrine, which is regarded as the home of Afrobeat, a genre of music founded by the legendary Fela Anikulapo-Kuti. “Very touched, congratulations to this young boy.” Macron tweeted on Tuesday. The French president, who was once a junior diplomat in Nigeria emphasised on the importance of the shrine to the African culture and hope many Europeans will be exposed to appreciate. Singer and actor Banky W, who anchored the event described praised Kareem for his skills. “This is the level of talent we have in Lagos; an eleven-year-old Kazeem drew this within 2 hours,” he said. “This is African energy. The one I discovered here in Lagos when I was 23. The one I am glad to see is still thriving several years later. The one I hope many Europeans will get to know.”
