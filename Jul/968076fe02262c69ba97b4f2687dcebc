 Balarabe Musa  Musa who spoke with The Guardian yesterday, said, “I didn’t advise Sani not to leave the APC and join another party, it is now clear that the situation that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) faced in 2015 when it refused to perform in Government is what is now playing out against the APC. If Sani decamps from the APC he should come back to the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) where he has his root and where he belongs”. “This government has refused to perform, so, several of its members are decamping. I expect that at the end of the day most of the members will join the opposition to rescue this country from this mess. I don’t see the APC coming back in 2019, just like the PDP was voted out of office in 2015. I expect more defection”. Meanwhile, the Adviser on politics and strategy to Senator Sani, Suleiman Ahmed said that there have been a lot of personalities that have been prevailing on the Senator not to dump APC. According to him, President Buhari, APC Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and Bola Tinubu were among the party leaders that have also prevailed on Sani not to leave the APC, saying that they have pledged to address the grievances that led to then crisis in the party. “We do not take the state broadcast by Governor Nasir El-Rufai in Kaduna serious. If they pressure Sani not to leave the APC who is El-Rufai to say that he should apologise to him?” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
