The Premier League champions have broken their club record to sign the 27-year-old winger from Leicester City for £60m. The Algerian winger joins the Premier League champions on a five-year deal after the two sides reached an agreement. He will wear number 26 shirt. “I am so pleased to have joined City, a side playing great football under Pep Guardiola,” Mahrez told the club’s website. The news brings an end to a deal that had long been in the making. Mahrez had come close to joining City when they made an offer for him on the final day of the transfer window in January, while he submitted a transfer request to the Foxes. Although Leicester rejected the bid and City backed out, Pep Guardiola suggested afterwards that they would return for him in the summer.
