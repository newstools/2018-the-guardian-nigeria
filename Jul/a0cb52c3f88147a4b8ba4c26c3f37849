Managing Director of Peace Mass Transit, Dr. Samuel Maduka Onyishi, gave the advice when he received staff members and management of the Peaceland College of Education, Enugu, who visited him. He said since private educational institutions do not receive government subventions for their activities, the only way to earn the people’s trust, is to ensure transparency in management of resources and also carry their students along. Onyishi said he was attracted to the Peaceland College by the level of commitment of its managers to “do things differently to improve learning and character.” Presenting N5million to assist in the running of the school, Onyishi said he was moved to do so “from the information I got from the Provost and members of staff that their name was chosen in honour of my business name, Peace Mass Transit. ” Provost of the College, Prof. Leo Ilechukwu, said the school appreciated the support it has received from the business mogul.
