It is evident that the Nigerian electricity issue has gotten out of hand. Enter the Iron man, Elon Musk, the designer of SpaceX and the product architect of Tesla. After successfully designing a submarine for the Thai rescue team, and promising to help the city of Flint get clean water, which has “water contamination above FDA levels”, Nigerians are now seeking his help to solve the herculean task. Here is the tweet that sparked the conversation:  Trust Nigerians to use the style they know best @elonmusk is smart but Nigeria's problems are unique. It's not like sending rockets to space, building solar panels and cars, or pods for cave rescue. The billionaire  Elon is helpless here — anonymous (@hemical) July 13, 2018   @elonmusk is smart but Nigeria's problems are unique.
