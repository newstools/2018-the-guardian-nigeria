Fuhrmann said that the behaviour of the motorists had slowed down early completion of the job as the workers could no longer concentrate for fear of being knocked down by vehicles. “This development has distracted us from concentrating fully on the job. “We need to be safety conscious as life is precious to us because an articulated vehicle can knock down any of us,” he said. He implored motorists to cooperate with the company to ensure quick rehabilitation of the highway. Fuhrmann explained that apart from affecting the pace of work, the behaviour of the motorists often cause gridlock, adding that the gridlock could stop the workers from performing their job.
