People do insane things in movies all the time, and most times we think of daring acts in movies, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson comes to mind. In Skyscraper, a movie released today, terrorists purposely set a 240-story building on fire in order to get at a flash drive locked away in the billionaire’s penthouse on top. That seems like an awful lot of trouble for a heist, and yet, it’s nothing compared to the extravagant lengths Dwayne Johnson’s character, Will Sawyer, will go. The Rock plays a security expert trying to rescue his family from the world’s tallest building after it’s been set on fire by terrorists. As the building burns, Johnson battles terrorists hundreds of stories in the air using only several meters of duct tape and his melon-like biceps. Not so much a story as The Rock’s upper body workout with explosions in the background, the movie pitches him into increasingly ridiculous situations, most of which involve dangling from great heights. Playing his army surgeon wife, Neve Campbell is also a pleasingly proactive presence, holding her own in combat and conflagration. Among other summer blockbusters like Ant-Man and the Wasp, Solo and Deadpool 2, Skyscraper is that rare beast: not a sequel, spin-off or aftermath entry. However, it is the greatest skyscraper-related underdog story. Skyscraper has a solid foundation in Johnson, who again proves to the world how reliably entertaining he is. Cleverly, Johnson’s all-action hero has a bit of vulnerability thanks to his heart-warming dedication to his family. His artificial leg becomes one of his most important tools in the race to save his family. You can watch this exhilarating movie at Filmhouse Cinemas nationwide.
