Varane’s header the difference in Nizhny Novgorod. 45 min: There will be two minutes of additional time as Umtiti fouls Suarez. The free kick is swung in but France defends their goal astutely. 44 min: SAVE!!! Lloris at full-stretch gets a hand to Caeceres’ header from Torreira’s free kick. That was very close to the equalizer by Uruguay. Varane raced towards the ball to head it in ahead of Stuani. Even bigger task now for Uruguay to try to claw their way back. Uruguay 0-1 France 40 min: The free-kick is played in by Griezmann and Varane heads it in. GOOOOALLLL!!!! 38 min: Bentancur is shown a yellow card after a poor challenge on Tolisso. 34 min: Mbappe races onto a pass on the wing and plays in a cross, but there was no one in the box to connect to the cross. 26 min: Laxalt stops Mbappe from getting into the box and concedes a corner.

Caceres does brilliantly to keep the ball in lay before winning a throw in. Uruguay really up for this. The game is already looking better than the stereotypical France attack vs Uruguay defence And we are underway! Does pulling Laxalt’s braid qualify as a life goal? I’d really really like to pull his braids. Away from life goals, Cavani definitely will be missed by Uruguay but Stuani will start in his place. And now the National Anthems!
