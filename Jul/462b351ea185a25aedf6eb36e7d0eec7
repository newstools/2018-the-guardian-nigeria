 Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar  During a courtesy call on the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar yesterday in Abuja, the envoy noted that the proposed partnership is aimed at enhancing the operational capability of NAF in the prosecution of the ongoing fight against insurgency and other forms of criminality in the country. He said his home government was not unaware of the milestones that had been recorded in the counter-terrorism fight. In-Tae added that his country recognises the contributions of the Air Force in enhancing security in Nigeria and was therefore willing to provide support in the area of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability as well as technical expertise, training and maintenance support. Responding, Abubakar congratulated the ambassador as well as the people and government of South Korea for successfully restoring peace in the Korean Peninsular. He then thanked the visitor for acknowledging NAFâ€™s efforts at repositioning the service for optimum service delivery. In addition, the military expressed appreciation to the Korean government for its readiness to cooperate with the force towards proffering solutions to some of its challenges, especially in the area of ISR.
