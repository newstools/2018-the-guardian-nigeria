The FRC Chief said the public hearing which had already been held in Imo and Rivers State respectively, would also take place in Gombe, Kano, Jos , Abuja and the South West  geopolitical zone of the country.He said, after the public hearing, the Code would be moved into committee level and thereafter, the agency would  engage the government on it to reach final position before the code is released to the public. The FRC boss said, the new code is designed with  good incentive, “the companies and organizations that applied the code better would succeed and have better grounds in business while the ones that do not implement it well will suffer a market reaction”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
