Late Adeniyi The Lagos State police boss, Imohimi Edgal, has called on members of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) with evidence on the mystery surrounding the death of the Apapa Local Government PDP chapter chairman, Borishade Adeniyi, to bring it before him to aid investigation by detectives. According to the spokesman of the command, Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), the attention of the command has been drawn to the claim by the PDP in the state that it has evidence as regards the circumstances surrounding the murder of Adeniyi at Igbosuku village, Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos on July 21, during the party’s meeting. “The Lagos CP urges the party to come forward with the evidence it claimed to have as reported in some sections of the media to the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, SCIID Panti Yaba for necessary action. The command assures the party of diligent investigation. “Meanwhile, all 11 suspects arrested in connection with the murder have been charged to court. However, this does not preclude further investigation into the case with a view to arresting other suspects linked to the crime. The CP warns all political parties in the state to conduct their affairs peacefully as the command will not tolerate political brigandage that can result in a breach of the public peace,” Oti said.
