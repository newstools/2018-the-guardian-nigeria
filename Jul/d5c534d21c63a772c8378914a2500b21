Dating back to the 15th Century, the traditional Bantu kingdom of Ankole in Uganda has always been peaceful despite maintaining a social caste system between the Bahima and the Bairu. Until its abolishment by President Milton Obote, they were ruled by a king called Mugabe or Omugabe. The Bahima are a pastoral people whose wealth is determined by the number of cattle they have acquired.
