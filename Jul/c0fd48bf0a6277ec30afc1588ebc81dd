 Ranching  With the benefit of historical evidence, one dares say that these so-called pilot ranches are designed to be future Fulani Emirates, or how do you, in any future (near or distant), disentitle armed nomadic Fulani herdsmen (defiantly armed with AK47 rifles that fell from heaven) to expanses of grazing territories acquired from State/Local Governments by the Federal Government of Nigeria for a consideration and certificates of occupancy (CofOs) to boot? Myetti Allah’s haughty claim (hinged on the protection of powerful patrons) that the killer herdsmen killed and are killing farmers, their wives and children to avenge the theft of their cattle by rustlers, thereby ranking animals higher than human beings (over 100 persons for 300 missing cows), clearly shows that the killer herdsmen are not foreigners after all!
  
Whereas section 319 of the Criminal Code Act (Cap. 77. Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990) provides that any person who commits murder shall be sentenced to death and be hanged by the neck until he be dead, section 390 (3) of the same Act, which is tangentially on all fours with section 287 of the Penal Code Act, stipulates that any person who steals any of the following, that is to say, “a horse, mare, gelding, ass, mule, camel, bull, cow, ox, ram, ewe, wether, goat or pig or the young of any such animal”, shall be liable, on conviction, to pay a fine of two hundred naira (N200) or to imprisonment for two years!
