Hepatitis, including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, are a group of distinct diseases that affect the liver. Each has different symptoms and treatments. Some causes of hepatitis include recreational drugs and prescription medications. Going for laboratory tests is very necessary and can help can determine hepatitis types. Hepatitis most times leads to life-threatening issues and complications if not detected early. Nevertheless, proper treatment and management can largely reduce these complications. It is essential to diagnose the cause of hepatitis before deciding on whether you have a more serious and irreversible type. The hepatitis vaccine helps the immune system to learn how to combat the virus if there is an infection. There is only a vaccine for Hepatitis A and B viruses. However, there is no suitable vaccine yet for hepatitis C. When it comes to other infectious and non-infectious types of hepatitis, these vaccines are not effective. Therefore, you can develop hepatitis through other means even if you had the hepatitis A and/or B vaccines. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-703398 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d.jpeg 708w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-640x360.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-320x180.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-281x158.jpeg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-562x316.jpeg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-531x299.jpeg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-1062x598.jpeg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-487x274.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12403_liver-pain-is-000045030308.jpg_bfdd402e-d590-4fb6-bb51-f53808c4d58d-600x337.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> It is possible to have hepatitis and have little to no symptoms for a long period.
