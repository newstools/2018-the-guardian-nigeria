The police in Lagos State have arrested five suspects after a shooting incident that claimed the life of a leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Aborishade Adeniyi, during the party’s meeting in the state. According to police sources, Adeniyi, identified as the Apapa Local Government PDP chairman, recognized also as the ‘doyen of PDP Local Government Chapter Chairmen’ in Lagos, died from gunshot wounds. The state police spokesman, CSP Chike Oti, revealed in a statement made available to The Guardian. “What was supposed to be a peaceful political meeting of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members, in Lagos State, regrettably ended in unnecessary bloodletting. “The incident took place on Saturday, July 21, at about 6:00p.m. during Lagos State PDP visitation meeting at Igbosuku Village, Eti-Osa LGA, attended by Lagos State and Local Government PDP chairmen. Towards the end of the meeting, fracas broke out between contending factions of the party; one faction for the state chairman, Moshood Adegoke Salvador and the other for the Eti-Osa LG chapter chairman, Kehinde Fasasi. “In the melee, one Borishade Adeniyi, the Apapa LG PDP chapter chairman, was shot and injured on the leg. He was rushed to First Consultant Hospital, Obalende, Lagos, where he was treated but eventually died. Body of the deceased is deposited in the hospital mortuary. Two other persons injured during the clash are also receiving treatment in a hospital in Ajah.” In a swift reaction, the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State command, Imohimi Edgal, has directed the Area Commander in-charge of Area ‘J’ Elemoro, to ensure the arrests of all those involved in the crime. Already, five principal suspects have been arrested. The suspects are: Kehinde Fasasi, chapter chairman, Eti-Osa LGA; Rotimi Kujore, chapter chairman, Lagos Island LGA; Alhaji Fatai Adele, chapter chairman, Mushin LGA; Ismail Abiola, chapter chairman, Amuwo Odofin LGA and Dr. Amos Alabi Fawole, chapter chairman, Surulere LGA. “The five suspects have been transferred to SCIID, Panti, for further investigation. The CP is worried about the use of firearms and the frequency of violence involving the PDP in the state. It will be recalled that on July 12, 2018, two suspected party thugs, Wale Oye, 37 and Ganiyu Ajiboluwa, 47, were arrested at Festac Extention by Apple Junction, Amuwo Odofin with two pump action rifles given to them by their hirer, one Dipo Olorunrinu, a member of the PDP in Lagos State House of Assembly, to escort him to a political rally. The said Olorunrinu was arrested and they are all helping the police in the investigation of the case. “CP warns that no political party will be allowed to truncate the peace in the state. He therefore calls on all political parties in Lagos to disarm their members as nobody without necessary authorisation is permitted to bear firearms. He added that henceforth, political party leaders will be liable for the actions of their supporters,” Oti added.
