 Prof. Lai Oso  He gave the advice while giving the closing remarks at the presentation and launch of a research report, “Understanding Nigerian Media and Elections Through Research (UNMETR): Analysis of the 2015 Presidential Election” at the Conference Room, School of Transport, Lagos State University (LASU). Quoting the report, Oso said personality-driven campaign promotes hate speech, which was pervasive during the 2015 election. The report, which was presented by two researchers, Prof. Rotimi Olatunji and Mr. Ayo Oluwatosin, considered the role of the media, public relations and advertising in influencing election campaigns, hate speeches and the result afterwards, the level of compliance on advertising codes, and the level of involvement of local and foreign agencies in electioneering processes. At the event, Oluwatosin noted that “The election process in Nigeria has been turbulent”, adding that this “makes the research very vital as elections are fast approaching.” He said the media, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), political parties, civil societies and relevant stakeholders should “take a cue from this report and make 2019 elections successful”. The vice chancellor of LASU, who was represented by the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Admin), Prof. Damola Oke, appreciated FORD Foundation for financially supporting the research.
