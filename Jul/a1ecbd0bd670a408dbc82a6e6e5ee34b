 Super Falcons  The competition is slated to hold in France from August 5 to 24. Izilien noted that the female U-20 team’s performance in the world championship would x-ray the level of women football development at the grassroots in Nigeria. He noted that the current crises in the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) may affect the girls’ preparations for the World Cup, adding, however, that it should not in any way deter the team from fighting to succeed in France. Izilien described the world championship as a big stage for Falconets to work hard and lunch themselves to stardom, and advised the girls to strive hard to beat the big teams to show that they also can play the game. “The Falconets need to be determined and focused to play at the World Cup. I am not expecting much from the girls because of inadequate preparations, but because the championship is for young girls from the grassroots, I believe with the right selection and commitment from the players the team would excel in France.
