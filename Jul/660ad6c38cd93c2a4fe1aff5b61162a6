 Dr. Kweku Tando  The school sports competition, which was held at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Centre, Rowe Park Yaba, saw no fewer than 658 students from 44 schools (public and private) taking part in traditional games of Abula, Kokowa, Ayo and Langa. Facilitated by the Lagos State Sports Commission and organised by the Lagos State Traditional Sports Association, the second edition of the traditional games was keenly contested by students, and at the end of the tournament, Ayo produced 20 male and 18 female student athletes. 16 female and 15 male athletes were discovered in Abula, while 15 male and 5 female athletes were discovered in Kokowa. Speaking at the finals, Dr Kweku Adedayo Tandoh, chairman of Lagos State Sports Commission, who led other management staff of the Commission, said that Lagos would leave nothing to chance in ensuring that every athletes, irrespective of the sport he or she is interested in, is given attention and a sense of belonging. He said that the authorities believe athletes, especially in the schools, are expose to all sports, even beyond popular sports. “These traditional sports are being recognised at the national level, as they are parts of the scoring sports in the National Sports Festival. And for us giving opportunities to our school children the chance to take part in these sporting activities is like not restricting them to some particular sports. “We will give all identified athletes the opportunity to grow in the games, especially as we are preparing the National Sports Festival in Abuja this year,” Tandoh said. The chairman thanked Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for giving the Sports Commission all support to deliver its mandates in Lagos sports. He also commended the officials for putting up a wonderful and colourful tournament.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
