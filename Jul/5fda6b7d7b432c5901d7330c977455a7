 Great Britain’s Christopher Froome looks on after crossing the finish line of the 17th stage of the 105th edition of the Tour de France cycling race, between Bagneres-de-Luchon and Saint-Lary-Soulan Col du Portet, southwestern France, on July 25, 2018.  / AFP PHOTO / Jeff PACHOUD  Team Sky leader Froome, a four-time champion, finished the stage in eighth place at 1min 35sec behind Colombian winner Nairo Quintana and 48secs behind teammate and overall leader Geraint Thomas. The Kenyan-born Briton had put on his rainjacket and was cycling back to the Team Sky bus when a policeman on the side of the road mistakenly took him for one of the thousands of cycling fans who traditionally ride up the mountain stages to catch a glimpse of their idols. He tried to get Froome to stop and in the confusion the six-time Grand Tour champion crashed. He avoided injury and is set to start stage 18 on Thursday. “It was a misunderstanding. Chris is fine,” said a Team Sky spokesman. Froome, who had been aiming for a fourth consecutive Grand Tour victory after triumphing at the Vuelta a Espana last year and this year’s Giro d’Italia, is now in a battle for a podium place. Team boss Dave Brailsford said they will now plan to make sure Froome joins Thomas on the Tour de France podium: “He’s not out of it necessariy, there’s a big mountain day to come, and the time trial. “We’ll sit down tonight, review everything, see how everybody feels then make our plan of attack.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
