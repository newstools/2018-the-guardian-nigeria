A patron of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), endorsed President Muhammad Buhari for a second term in office in 2019, Femi Adesina, spokesman for Buhari said on Wednesday. According to Adesina, Ambassador Eze Ebere, who visited the Presidential Villa on Wednesday, said President Muhammadu Buhari has done enough to be reelected in 2019 when the country goes to poll. “President Buhari has our unflinching support for a second term in office, because he is doing great things for our country, and another term will help him to consolidate, for the good of Nigeria,” Ebere said. Buhari, a former general and military head of state, was voted into power in 2015 and has announced that he will be seeking reelection in 2019. The 75-year-old president had earlier signed a “not too young to run” bill on May 31st which alters Nigeria’s 1999 constitution that stipulates that the president has to be at least 40, while senators and state governors have to be aged 35 or above. The bill, however, reduces the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, and state governors and senators from 35 to 30. The age limit for state assembly will be 25.
