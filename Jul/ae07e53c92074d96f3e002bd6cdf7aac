 INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu  The body also charged the security agencies that would be deployed for the poll to be extra vigilant and expose all forms of rigging to save the country’s democracy. In a statement by its National Chairman, Balarabe Musa, the group urged politicians in Ekiti to play by the rules of the game, and cautioned that the outcome of the poll would determine voters’ confidence in the 2019 general elections. He said: “We must remind ourselves that the survival of democracy is vital at this time. For this to happen, all stakeholders must subject themselves to the ultimate will of the electorate. “INEC, the media and all security agencies, as well as election observers in the governorship election must be vigilant.” Musa urged INEC to ensure that the outcome of the election reflects the virtues of fairness, good conscience, rule of law and credibility, adding that holding a credible election in Ekiti was necessary to boost the confidence of the electorate in the country’s electoral process. He added that it would further elevate the rating of the current leadership of INEC, especially as the country prepares for the 2019 general elections. The CNPP chief said at no time in the history of the country has the younger people shown eagerness to fully participate in the electoral process than now. He stressed that it was the duty of INEC and the security agencies to reassure the people that their votes are not only counted, but also count in determining who leads them. “We equally appeal to politicians, especially the candidates in the election to play according to the rules. They must allow the electorate to choose who governs them without intimidation, and in an atmosphere of peace,” he said.
