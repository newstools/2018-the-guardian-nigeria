A few days ago, media and entertainment brand, Trace TV hosted the historic visit by the French President, Emmanuel Macron to the New Afrika Shrine. With the dust of the Macron charm yet to settle, the company is rolling out the red carpets again for what promises to be an iconic theatrical performance by Nigeria’s raving Rapper Falz to be held at Terra Kulture on the 13th of July. The Falz show is the fourth in the Trace Live series that has in the past hosted the likes of Omawunmi, Flavour and Adekunle Gold with each acoustic display redefining the landscape of Live Music in Nigeria and also re-casting the said Acts in brilliant forms. First was Omawumi who reasserted herself as a musical phenomenon at the maiden edition. Then Flavour rehashed highlife with a dash of sultry pop to the cheering of a very discerning crowd. Adekunle Gold took it a notch by thrilling the audience with his new and critically-acclaimed album, About 30. Trace Live (a new landmark in live music that highlights only the best blend of vocals and musical instruments) with Falz would continue this trajectory with the Rapper’s insightful hit This is Nigeria that has gotten the whole country wagging for its pungent criticism of the Nigerian state.
