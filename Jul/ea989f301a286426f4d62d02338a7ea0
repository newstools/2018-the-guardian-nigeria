DEEPEN project was designed to facilitate a more enabling environment for low-cost private schools and create an effective market that would enable them offer quality education for children from low-income households. The overall aim of the project was to reposition low income schools; expose them to market opportunities and best practices; improve learning outcomes in the sector and above all, encouraged government to rather than clampdown on the low-income schools, see the operators as partners in progress. The team also through series of its research-based programmes, linked operators of the low-cost schools to service providers; offered massive training on finance, savings and taxation which liberated the group from illegal taxation by unscrupulous individuals. The programme, which will wind down next month did not only meet its objectives but also surpassed its target, according to the beneficiaries. The pilot project was implemented in Lagos owing to its large and growing population.
