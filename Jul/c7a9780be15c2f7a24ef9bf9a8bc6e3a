As many parts of Lagos State continue to be dotted by heaps of refuse, the Rotaract Club of Agege at the weekend evacuated tons of waste from Powerline, Ota Road in Orile Agege. They were supported in the herculean task by members of the Rotary Club of Agege, CLI Street Captains and members of the community. Numbering over 20, they gathered at 7:00a.m. on Saturday, the day that was until recently the monthly environmental sanitation in the state, to clear the huge refuse at the entrance to the community, which is by the Arigbanla Canal. Speaking on the reasons for the initiative, Director of Youth Activities, Rotary Club of Agege, Rotn. Victoria Kapo, said disease prevention is one of the six focus areas of Rotary International. “The heap of refuse is not only an eyesore but a health risk. If residents must stay healthy, one of the things to do is desist from dumping waste here. “We noticed that this area, which is densely populated, is always flooded and the roads impassable whenever it rains. This is why we are evacuating the waste and also sensitizing residents on keeping their environment clean.” President of the Rotaract Club of Agege, Helen Jegede, said the clean-up was part of its annual sanitation exercise tagged Cleaner Community, Healthier Citizens, which seeks to educate members of the public on how to keep themselves free from diseases. Some community leaders, however, want the state government to reappraise the Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI) as according to them, it is not working.“CLI only comes once in a month and they don’t go into the streets, they only stay at the main road to evacuate waste, which has encouraged residents to keep their wastes at the main road corners for pick up. The previous arrangement was working because they come into the streets every week, but since people can’t be living with their waste, they have to dispose it somehow,” Alhaji Olawale Akinola noted. The state chairman of CLI Street Captains, a group of volunteers, Mrs. Abimbola Tijani Oladokun, said they will send a report of the complaints of the residents to the state government. She noted that the inconsistencies in the evacuation of waste was due to the disagreement between the PSPs and the government, which has been resolved.
