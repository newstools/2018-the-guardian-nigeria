Juventus have been making big moves in the transfer market this summer following the capture of Cristiano Ronaldo for £100million and now the release of it’s latest kit, made by Adidas in a collaboration with a non-profit organisation called Parley for the Oceans. The Italian champions are now doing their bit to rid the Earth’s oceans of plastic after releasing their new third kit ahead of next season, Cristiano Ronaldo and his new teammates will be wearing gear made from a 100% recycled polyester interlock material that incorporates ocean plastic for this season as Juventus look to win an eight successive Serie A title. The official colours of the kit will be “carbon” and “‘shock yellow”.
