 Ike Shorunmu  He also believes the development has opened the doors for other goalkeepers to work hard to cover the vacuum created by Ikeme’s absence from the team. Ikeme retired from professional football last week apparently on doctors advise after successfully battling acute leukemia. Shorunmu, who worked with Ikeme briefly, said the 32-year-old Wolvehampton Wanderers goaltender always galvanised players and coaches in every game he mounted the sticks. The former Eagles goalkeeper, however, called on football loving Nigerians to see Ikeme’s retirement as a means to preserve his life, adding that the keeper has more goals to achieve in his future endeavours. “It is a pity Ikeme has to retire from football this early.

The Eagles goalkeeper performed well during his short stint with the Super Eagles. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
