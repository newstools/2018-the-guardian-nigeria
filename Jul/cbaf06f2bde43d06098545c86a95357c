Detectives attached to Ogun State police command have arrested a medical doctor and his nurse for carrying out an abortion that led to the death of their patient. According to police spokesman Oyeyemi Abimbola, the suspect, Dr. Olawale Raji and a nurse, Olusegun Funmilayo, are now being quizzed by investigators for carrying out an abortion that led to the death of Aminat Iyanda Atisola. “Their arrest followed a complaint from the sister of the deceased, Bose Kazeem, of No. 6, Ireakari Street, Atan Ota, who reported that her deceased sister was two months pregnant and contracted the service of the two suspects who are working in a private hospital for the abortion of the pregnancy. She stated further that the suspects carried out the unlawful act right inside the house of the deceased. “Trouble started when the deceased started having complications shortly after the abortion and she was rushed to the Federal Medical Center Abeokuta for treatment but died on the way. On receiving the report, the DPO Onipanu Division, SP Sangobiyi Johnson, led his team of detectives to the scene where the two medical practitioners were arrested. The body of the 35-year-old deceased has been deposited at the general hospital morgue for post mortem examination. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, CP Ahmed Iliyasu, has ordered that the suspects be transferred to Homicide section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for proper investigation and prosecution. “He equally warned that abortion remains an unlawful act and whoever is caught engaging in it without any medical justification will have the law of the land to contend with. The CP further appealed to members of the public to always seek lawful professional advice on any health related issue,” Oyeyemi said.
