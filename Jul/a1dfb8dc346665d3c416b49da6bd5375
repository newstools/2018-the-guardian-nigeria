He said the activities lined up for the event would create awareness on the importance of breastfeeding to a child’s survival and how to improve on poor practices of exclusive breastfeeding. “Poor exclusive breastfeeding practices in Nigeria have been associated with inadequate support from husbands, partners and health professionals. Others include, delayed initiation of breastfeeding, negative peer influences as well as short paid maternity leave for working mothers. A platform for long-term collaboration of all advocates, activists, decision makers, media, and youths are vital for promoting optimal infant and young child-feeding practices,’’ he said.
