 Chairman, Mr. Darwish Foudeh (left); Principal, AviCenna International School, Mr. David Ogburn; and other guests at the graduation ceremony of the 2018 class in Ikeja, Lagos.  The Principal, Mr. David Ogburn, gave the advice as the students drawn from five countries, bade farewell to the school where most of them had spent the last 11 years of their lives. Ogburn described the young scholars as “an industrious group with a zest for learning new things and a desire to create the best opportunities for themselves.” The graduation themed “The world is ours” and held at the school premises in Ikeja was attended by the chairman, Mr. Darwish Foudeh, parents and friends. Representative of the current students, Chiwuike Anyiam-Osigwe, said members of the outgoing class of 2018 would be greatly missed but reassured that those being left behind would hold the fort and make the graduating students proud. He stated that the basketball and debate teams, which have both earned the school several awards, would be strengthened. One of the many highlights of the ceremony was the melodious and heart-rending performance of Whitney Houston’s “I will always love you”, by Anjani, one of the outgoing students, which ended in thunderous applause from all the guests. Valedictory speaker and outgoing Head girl, Teniola Folaranmi, enjoined the current students not to be discouraged by other people’s doubts in their abilities, but to use those doubts as inspiration to be the best. “There’s no failure, if you just keep trying,” she said.
