 EFCC  At the maiden multi-agency solidarity launch yesterday, the GOC together with representatives from the Nigerian police, The Nigerian Air force (NAF), The Nigerian Navy (NN), Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Department of State Services (DSS), Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and some prison controllers have pronounced equality on all security officers, saying they all stand for one cause, hence must work together to protect the territorial integrity of the society. Udoh declared his intentions of promoting effective inter-service and inter-agency synergy that would ultimately ensure efficient discharge of individual service and agency mandate. â€œIrrespective of our organizational mandates, we all have a common mandate because we share overlapping arrears of command, zones and jurisdictions, whatever may be the designation of our assigned area of operation, we are bound to cross each others path while discharging our duties. Lagos State Assistant Commissioner of Police, Yomi Shogunle called for agencies to join forces to promote unity in securing the lives of Nigerians.
