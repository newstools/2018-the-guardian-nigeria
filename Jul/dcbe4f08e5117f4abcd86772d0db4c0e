Buffon, who played 176 times for Italy, is expected to sign for two years and be presented to the press on Monday. He would be the first signing since German Thomas Tuchel took over as PSG manager in May. The club already has Kevin Trapp, who was part of Germany’s squad at the World Cup, and Alphonse Areola, who is with France in Russia.
