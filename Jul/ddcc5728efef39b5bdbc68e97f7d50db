The Committee for Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) yesterday alleged that the Delta State police command was trying to frustrate and sweep under the carpet investigation into the shooting death of its member, Comrade Christian Njoku, by policemen on patrol duty. The activist was shot and killed by a police patrol team on June 18, 2018 at about 9:30p.m. along Jakpa Road, Effurun, Uvwie council area of Delta State, allegedly during a shootout with the police. The police had claimed the late activist who was driving in a car with three other men engaged them in a shootout and was killed, but the CDHR said the deceased was an honest businessman and had never been involved in any criminal issue. They said they police shot the activist for arguing with them that night. The CDHR urged the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris and the Delta Commissioner of Police, CP Muhammad Mustafa, not to sweep the findings in its ongoing investigation under the carpet as this would amount to perverting justice. They vowed not to relent until the policemen who murdered its member, were brought to justice. Addressing reporters at the spot where the victim was shot dead by the police team on Jakpa road, CDHR chairman, Comrade Prince Kehinde Taiga, who led the protest, said the police must first set the record straight on the victim’s identity so as to correct the wrong impression already created that he was an armed robber. “We are demanding that an unreserved apology be tendered to the family of the deceased for both the physical and psychological trauma they have been subjected to over the death of their son. This apology will go a long way in removing the dent the malicious police report has brought to the family name.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
