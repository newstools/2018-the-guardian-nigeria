Sterling Bank may not be the most popular bank in Nigeria. But on Saturday, it crept into the consciousness of many Nigerians, perhaps, potential customers, all thanks to a tweet, which has since gone viral. The tweet is a less-than-subtle shade thrown at the banks’ rivals including Guaranty Trust Bank, Access Bank, First Bank and Union Bank. It contains a graphic with the logos of the four banks manipulated to show they are not worthy of customers’ attention. It was not long before the four banks, sans GTBank, started to respond with digs of their own. Access Bank’s reply has been liked and retweeted more than Sterling’s trigger tweet. Union Bank followed suit quick. It took the bank three tweets to hit the home run. The last tweet, however, comes a tone finality and with allusion to the beefs between Nas and Jay-Z (Ether) and Pusha T and Drake (Story of Adidion). And if you are familiar with hip-hop, you will know that ‘Ether’ by Nas and ‘Story of Adidion’ are among the stop knock-them-dead diss tracks.    The oldest bank among the lot also fired its own two-tweet salvo.   Guaranty Trust Bank has refused to be drawn into the catfight. Silence is golden?
