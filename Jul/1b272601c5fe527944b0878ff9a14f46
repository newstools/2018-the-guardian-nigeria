Two Federal Government institutions, a filling station, three hotels as well as the complex of a telecommunications company were yesterday sealed off by the Enugu State government for allegedly failing to remit about N30 billion in taxes to its coffers. The affected institutions include the National Orientation Agency (NOA), National Examination Council (NECO), the micro-finance bank of the University of Nigeria (UNN), Golden Royale, Brifina and Blue Island hotels as well as the Etisalat office complex. The state government has also threatened to seal off the UNN campuses in Nsukka and Enugu for alleged failure to remit about N12 billion in taxes to its coffers. The chairman of the Board of Internal Revenue, Emeka Odo, told journalists at the end of the operation that the board obtained exparte orders from the State High Court to seal off the affected institutions. He said they would remain under lock and key until they remit to the state government all the taxes they had collected and withheld. He said the government had encouraged individual tax payers and tax agents to comply voluntarily by paying their taxes promptly, explaining that the process of remittances of government revenues had been reformed in order to make it easy for institutions to pay
like other corporate citizens. On the UNN, Odoh alleged as the highest employer of labour outside the state government, the university had refused to remit over N12 billion from deductions made from workers. Odo said the agency refused to seal off the institution at the same time with others because of its determination to follow-through with the necessary procedure. According to him, once the necessary court orders are obtained, the agency will not hesitate to lock up the university campuses in the state. He urged the management to quickly do the needful before it becomes too late. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
