 APC leader, Adams Oshiomole  Oshiomole, who spoke with State House Correspondents after a meeting with President Mohammadu Buhari, alleged that the plot was being orchestrated by the former President and his allies in the opposition parties “just to capture power in 2019,” a dream he could not actualize in 2007. The APC Chair, who spoke against the backdrop of the threats of mass defection from the party, expressed confidence that the APC will emerge victorious in 2019 despite the mounting opposition trailing it. He boasted that the ruling party would not allow the country to return to the era of sleaze and other forms of corruption, which characterised the former PDP-led administration in Nigeria. He said contrary to insinuations, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was the one suffering the brunt of defections despite the gang-up against the APC-led administration in the country. “They are the ones, who have suffered huge, huge mass defection even with t­he so called founding fathers. I mean, in those good old days, people like Prof. Jerry Gana will tell us, ‘we are the founding fathers.’ People like President Obasanjo will tell us, ‘you know I was the first President.’ “All of these people are gone. I think the media need to get more engage and scrutinise us, who are political players, when we speak from both sides of the mouth or we turning the story upside down. “Just few months back, you know that a good section after their convention, people like Oyederan, Professor Jerry Gana and a host of others, who can be said to be founding fathers of that party, they left to form what they call SDP or ADC or both.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
