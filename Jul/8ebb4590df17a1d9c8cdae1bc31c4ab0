Anthony Okpotu Anthony Okpotu has joined Moroccan side  from Lobi Stars in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). The striker will be officially unveiled on Friday evening as a player of Difaa El Jadida after he signed a three-year deal on Wednesday. Okpotu, 24, was the highest goal score in the last NPFL season with 19 goals. His goal-scoring ability earned him a place with the Nigerian team at the Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) that held in Morocco in January 2018. His goals and work rate helped the home-based Eagles finish second to Morocco. Okpotu leaves the NPFL and Lobi Stars for a second time after his ill-fated stint with Libyan side Al-Ittihad Tripoli in 2013. He had a trial with  Brondby IF but was not signed Danish Superliga side eventually. Okpotu becomes the third NPFL striker in recent years to move to Morocco, joining Osaguona Ighodaro (Raja Casablance, 2013) and Chisom Chikatara (Wydad Casablanca, 2016). Difaa El Jadida are currently fifth in the Botola, the Moroccan football League and will hope Okpotu’s goals will fire them to the top of the league.
