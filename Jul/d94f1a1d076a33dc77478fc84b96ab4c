The Screaming Orgasm is a cocktail that has made way for more refined drinks. But that doesn’t mean they are no longer in demand. The original drink called an “Orgasm” did not have vodka added. The addition of vodka to the drink (and some other drinks for that matter) added the word “Screaming” to it. Its controversial name made it quite popular. To make a Screaming Orgasm, you can follow our recipe below. It’ll be sure to keep the weekend groove going and perhaps help you live up to its name if you get what that means.
