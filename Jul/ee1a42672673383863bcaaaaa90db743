A man, Nwachukwu Ejima Owelle, from Aboh in Ndokwa East Local Government Area of Delta State has disappeared to an unknown destination following threats to his life over his refusal to become the chief priest of the townâ€™s deity, Alishi and Oje masquerade. It was gathered that Nwachukwu, born August 24, 1979, was last seen in September 2017. He is by tradition of Aboh Kingdom the chief custodian of Alishi deity and bearer (chief priest) of the Oje masquerade following the death of his father. He ran away, hence refusing to accept the offer and be crowned as the chief priest of Aboh Kingdom, because he is a Christian. This, the town considered a taboo and it is causing chaos in the kingdom. The Olinzeles (chiefs in council) of the kingdom have since declared him wanted, saying he must come to face the consequences of his action.
