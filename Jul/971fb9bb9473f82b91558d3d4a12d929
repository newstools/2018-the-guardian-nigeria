Argentinian referee Nestor Pitana gestures during the Russia 2018 World Cup round of 16 football match between Croatia and Denmark at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium in Nizhny Novgorod on July 1, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Martin BERNETTI / FIFA has assigned Argentine referee, Nestor Pitana, to officiate the first quarter-final match between Uruguay and France in the ongoing Russia 2018 World Cup . The 43-year-old referee will be assisted by compatriots Hernan Maidana and Juan Belatti. Maidana will be the Assistant Referee 1 (AR1) and Belatti will be the Assistant Referee 2 (AR2). Pitana’s calls and decisions will be heavily scrutinized in the match with possible fears of the Argentine referee favouring Uruguay because his country was knocked out of the tournament by France in the round of 16 last Saturday in a stunning 4-3 victory. Other officials to assist Pitana during the game are Alireza Faghani and Reza Sokhandan, both of Iran, as Reserve Assistants in the match slated for Friday. During this World Cup, Pitana has taken charge of the Opening Match between Russia and Saudi Arabia, Mexico-Sweden and Croatia-Denmark. The build-up to Friday’s quarter-final clash between France and Uruguay has been dominated by individuals. Uruguay is hoping on the fitness of striker Edinson Cavani, it should be remembered that La Celeste’s progress in Russia has been built upon their defence as much as their A-list attack. And while France pin their hopes on Kylian Mbappe, it is unlikely that the teenage superstar has encountered a defence quite like Uruguay’s.
