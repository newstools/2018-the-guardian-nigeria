 Kayode Fayemi  Justice Oathman Musa dismissed the suit seeking to bar the All Progressives Congress (APC) from fielding Fayemi as its candidate in the election.The court, in its judgment yesterday in Abuja, dismissed the suit instituted by the Action Peoples Party (APP), the APC and the Ekiti State government, on the ground that it was frivolous, baseless and without merit. Justice Oathman said from the available evidence, Fayemi who is a former governor of Ekiti State was invited as a witness to assist the tribunal with information.He added that the tribunal had set aside the objection he raised, but did not go further to issue another invitation for him to appear as an accused person, as required by law. A chieftain of the APC, Oladimeji Olakunle Olatunji, had also asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to disqualify Fayemi.Addressing the press yesterday in Abuja, he said: “The constitution must take its course; the party has a constitution and guidelines, which the candidate of the APC, Fayemi did not oblige to.” Olatunji had accused Fayemi of submitting false information to the APC, and the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) as it relates to his resignation from the public service.He faulted his participation and winning of the party’s primaries organised by the INEC, on the basis of which he is contesting the July 14 election. Meanwhile, the ex-governor yesterday met President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.He declined to speak with State House Correspondents after the meeting.Buhari had during his valedictory session after his resignation, said he was not in a hurry to find his replacement, and wished him well in the election.The president declared that the APC candidate performed excellently as minister in his cabinet.
