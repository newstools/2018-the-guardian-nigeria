 President General of Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo (Jnr)  Caretaker Chairman of Ohanaeze, Bayelsa State chapter, Nlem Mark made the clarifications in a meeting with local chapters of Ohanaeze in Ogbia Local Government Area at the weekend. Although Atiku was recently in the state to seek support for his presidential ambition on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Mark said it was against the objectives of the group to delve into partisan politics. The chairman, who described the alleged endorsement as a disgrace and unfortunate, said those who purportedly endorsed Atiku Abubakar when the PDP had yet to pick its presidential candidate were impostors and political jobbers aiming for monetary gains. According to him, the endorsement was made by suspended members of the group led by one Chief Chinedu Amaku, parading themselves as leaders of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Bayelsa. Also, the youth wing of Ohanaeze in Bayelsa issued a communiqué signed by its leader, Chinedu Arthur-Ugwa, who urged the Bayelsa State government to severe links with the impostors. “The claim that the Secretary to Bayelsa Government was the force behind their actions is regrettable; if it is true, it leaves us to assume that they were behind the disunity which our elders are working to end,” Arthur-Ugwa said. “The President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo, had urged the state government to work in harmony with the caretaker committee pending elections. “We, therefore, wonder why some appointees of the governor chose to align with suspended members to sabotage the Nwodo-led leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. The group noted that the protracted leadership crisis was retarding the progress of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Bayelsa.
