Prominent Nigerians have congratulated The Guardian as it clocked 35. Senate President Bukola Saraki praised the publication for the landmark achievements it has recorded over the decades. “The success story of The Guardian in the last 35 years is worthy of emulation, especially in the nation’s media industry beset by high mortality rate. It has survived as a business concern and transcended generational change in leadership as a result of focus and dedication,” he said. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, the Senate President described the paper as a successful model of entrepreneurship in the country’s media industry. He praised the dedication and loyalty of the management and staff of the flagship to the ideals and philosophy of the paper, which have helped it endure for 35 years in spite of challenges. He described the successes recorded as a result of doggedness and dynamism, which Nigerian entrepreneurs must emulate to succeed. “I must commend its founder, the late Chief Alex Ibru, his wife Mrs. Maiden Ibru, her son Mr. Toke Ibru, and other directors, as they doggedly held the forte, as well as the generation of intellectually savvy employees and contributors, who have helped to sustain the dream of the founder and the philosophy of the paper till today,” he said. He noted that that the contributions of The Guardian to the attainment and sustenance of democracy, promotion of the ideals of free press and economic development in the country place it in an enviable position among the nation’s three longest surviving tabloids. Akwa Ibom State governor, Udom Emmanuel, also praised The Guardian for “sustaining the culture of excellence so proudly established 35 years ago in Nigerian journalism.” In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ekerete Udoh, Emmanuel stressed: “It is noteworthy that you have not deviated from this noble tradition.” He added: “As you turn 35, I urge you to continue shining the light on truth. Promote and project those issues and ideals that speak to our common purpose and hopes, and eschew those that amplify our differences.” The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) commended The Guardian for upholding its motto, ‘Conscience Nurtured By Truth,’ a watchword it said has remained eminently manifest in its strong editorial policy and the credibility of reportage in all its titles. It particularly recalled “the pivotal roles played by The Guardian and other media houses during the military era, leading to the return of democracy, and for which it was shut down for 18 months and its editors jailed under the obnoxious military Decree 4 of 1984.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
