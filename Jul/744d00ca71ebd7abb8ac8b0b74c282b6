   The State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr. Lawrence Onoja Jr, who made the commendation, added that, since the commencement of the military operation on May 18, 2018, the spate of attacks in Benue have reduced, with most of the invaders being repelled in several communities. Onoja made this disclosure in Markurdi, saying that consequently, some of those displaced were enabled to return to their homes, even though these have been reduced to rubbles and their means of livelihood completely destroyed. He said: “The achievement was a no mean feat and was accomplished at great expense, with some of the security personnel involved paying the supreme sacrifice, while others have suffered various degrees of injuries. “The government and people of Benue State, in this regard, wish to commend all the security agencies involved in Operation Whirl Stroke, particularly troops of the armed forces for their effectiveness in curtailing the menace of killer herdsmen in the state.”He, however, urged the operation to continue to abide and execute orders, as stated by the Acting Director of Defence Information, Brigadier General John Agim, which “include to track, fish out and come down heavily on the camps of the militants and to shoot and kill any cow used as shield.” He reiterated the call of Benue State government for the arrest and prosecution of leaders of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), as well as, those of the Fulani Nationality Movement, who have openly claimed responsibility for the pogrom in Benue and other states of the country.
