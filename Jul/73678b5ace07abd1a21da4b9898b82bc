Typically, there are three skin types; dry, oily and combination. Dry skin and oily skin are self-explanatory, and combination skin is a little bit of both. According to Dr Tess Mauricio of M. Beauty Clinic, you can try the three-step blotting test below to determine your skin type. 1. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and water. Use your hands to clean your face and avoid scrubbing too hard. 2. Dry your face with a towel and leave your skin alone for one hour without applying any products or touching it. 3. After one hour, if your face feels tight, you have dry skin. After blotting your skin with tissue paper, if there’s oil on your T-zone (forehead, nose and chin), but not your cheeks, you have combination skin. If you do the same tissue-paper test on your cheeks, and there’s an oily shine on your T-zone and cheeks, you have oily skin. However, if your skin looks discoloured and feels tingly, you have a sensitive skin.   Now that you know your skin type, you can choose the best products that will deliver a healthier, more radiant complexion.
