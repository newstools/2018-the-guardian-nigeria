 Imo State Assembly<br />PHOTO: Imo State Government  According to investigation, the inclusion in the programme of the day of the piece of legislation prohibiting rearing and grazing of livestock but providing for the establishment of ranches and livestock administration, regulation and control, among other matters, elicited palpable anxiety among the lawmakers. The proposal, titled a “Bill for a Law to prohibit open rearing and grazing of livestock and provide for establishment of Ranches and Livestock Administration, Regulation and Control for other Matters connected therewith,” was greeted with enchantments, reflective of the mood in the entire South East region. A couple of days ago, governors and leaders of the zone had rejected ranching.
