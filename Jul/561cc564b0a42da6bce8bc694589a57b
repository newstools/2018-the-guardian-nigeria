The authorities have not contacted Anthony or any of his representatives about this matter,” the spokesperson added. TheBlast.com, citing sources close to the case, said the alleged victim took months to decide to talk and was encouraged by the #MeToo movement. The question now on the minds of the fans of Black-ish is: will the show get cancelled because of this allegation? ***AFP
