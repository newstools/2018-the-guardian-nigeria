Although it may seem as though the name “Mistake Island”was coined just for no reason or as a joke, the name is actually a corruption of the word “Moosabec” – a name believed to have had its origins in an Abenaki word, possibly meaning “moose head”. Looking at the surroundings around Mistake Island, there seems to be no logic at all for it’s name. This only shows that there don’t always have to be a reason behind naming places.
