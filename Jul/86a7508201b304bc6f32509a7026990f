• Move to probe NNPC, policemen killing in Abuja
• Back suspension of Ovie Omo-Agege for 180 legislative days The National Assembly has transmitted the controversial Petroleum Industry Governance (PIG) Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari for his assent, it was learnt yesterday. A source close to the office of the Senate President said the clean copy of the Bill was sent to the President on July 3, 2018. The enactment followed the adoption of the report of the conference committee on the PIG Bill, which harmonised the versions earlier passed by the Senate and House of Representatives. In another development, the National Assembly has decried the delay by the Federal Government in releasing the 33 per cent of pension fund arrears approved since 2010. Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Pension, Hassan Shekarau, however said the House was working seriously to pressurise the government to release the money to enable the senior citizens enjoy their retirement life. Shekarau spoke yesterday while inspecting the ongoing pre-retirement verification exercise organised by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, for Federal Government employees who will exit service next year. He said the exercise would enable the commission to know the quantum of money required and followed by a budgetary provision. In a related vein, the House has resolved to probe the NNPC over alleged under-remittance of revenues to the Federation Account from January this year to date. Adopting a motion sponsored by Mr. Ossai Nicholas Ossai at the plenary yesterday presided by Speaker Yakubu Dogara, the House resolved to set up an ad-hoc committee to probe the crude oil sales as well as other sources of funds to the NNPC within the period under the review. The committee is expected to turn in its findings within two weeks for further legislative action. Ossai (APC, Delta), while moving the substantive motion under matters of urgent national importance, expressed the fear that the NNPC might one day declare zero revenue to the nation’s purse if left unchecked. Besides, the House has set up an ad-hoc committee to investigate the rising phenomena of insecurity in the country occasioned by killings and kidnapping all over the federation, proffer solutions and report back within six weeks for further legislative action. It also resolved that the constitutional amendment with regards to credible options for effective policing of our communities should be revisited. The resolution followed the adoption of a motion moved by Chris Emeka Azubogu on the urgent national security attention on the killing of seven policemen and others by unknown gunmen in Galadimawa. Meanwhile, the House yesterday endorsed the recommendation of a joint ad-hoc committee of the National Assembly, which recommended the immediate suspension of Ovie Omo-Agege for 180 legislative days. The lawmakers, while adopting the 10-point recommendation of the joint panel, further called for the immediate prosecution of Omo-Agege and six other suspects on charges of treasonable felony and assault, harm, conspiracy to steal and actual theft of the mace.
