The Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) officials at the weekend shut down five illegal bonded terminals and five other buildings in Ajegunle area of the state to ensure free-flow of traffic. The popular Godday Cinema that had existed for decades in the area was closed down while residential buildings converted to commercial purposes without approval were also shut down. Besides, the Queena Bonded Terminal, Don Climax Bonded Terminal and several buildings and terminals were sealed by the agency.LASBCA ‘s Secretary, Mr. Tayo Fakolujo, representing the General Manager, Mr. Lekan Shodeinde, said the exercise was part of the efforts to ensure that buildings are constructed according to building plan approval granted by its sister agency, Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA). He said all bonded terminals operating within the residential areas would be sealed up, as the genesis of Apapa gridlock was due to indiscriminate citing of tank farms and bonded terminals without an approval from the state government.The agency’s official, however, said with the new monitoring and auditing of building exercise, the state would prosecute any recalcitrant operator of a terminal or owner who converts the residential building to commercial usage without proper regularisation and engineering appraisal of the building.
