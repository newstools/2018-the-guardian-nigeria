Being single in this part of the world can be quite a weight! It feels like living your life with a tag that reads “Something is wrong with me” because people constantly give you that why-are-you-not-yet-married look! Have you been there? Have you developed a phobia for weddings simply because you don’t want to be interrogated on when you are getting hooked? Good news; you are not alone! It’s impossible to fully grasp the idea behind marriage without deferring to the Initiator and Designer of the institution. What is the purpose of a man and woman coming together in holy matrimony? What are the ideal characteristics in choosing a spouse? Can you tell if/when you are ready for marriage?

This Saturday, the 7th of July 2018; Pastors Ifeanyi and Paul Adefarasin will host the Singles’ Meeting at House On The Rock (The Rock Cathedral)Church Lekki. An informal gathering held regularly and anchored by the senior pastors, the event promises to be a great time of real talk. Armed with over 25 years of married life, they come with very instructive insights and a wealth of experience that every single person can glean from. In the words of Pastor Ifeanyi Adefarasin, “Don’t come alone; bring your friends along too – your story may be the catalyst for someone else’s upliftment”. “Save the date, clear out your calendar and make plans to attend” she further encouraged. Once again, it holds at House on the Rock (The Rock Cathedral), by Conoil Junction, Lekki-Epe Expressway, Lekki Lagos on Saturday 7th, July 2018 and begins at 10 am.
