Besides, those evident have not in anyway shown that the accused really committed the offences they were been charged. “The Hearsays evidence is not a party to the case and is not acceptable to the court. The prosecutor has a burden duty to prove the accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt,” Abbas said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
