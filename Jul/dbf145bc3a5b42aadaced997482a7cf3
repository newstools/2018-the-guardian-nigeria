Duke called on all Nigerians to recognize the strength in cultural diversity and awaken democratic activism, stating that Nigeria, cannot live in penury despite the abundance of talents and skills. “The essence of the privilege of my speaking to you today is a clarion call to each and everyone of us, particularly our youth, to recognize our strength in our diversity, and to awaken to democratic activism, actualize the powers imbued in your rights of suffrage with a conscious realisation that skills, industry, productivity, and competitiveness are determinant factors for national greatness.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
