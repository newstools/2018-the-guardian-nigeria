Looking for a light summer comedy? TAG is definitely the comic relief you need. “Tag” is, like the game itself, a whole lot of turbulent fun, and we are excited about this one too. For one month every year, five highly competitive friends hit the ground running in a no-holds-barred game of tag they have been playing since the first grade—risking their necks, their jobs and their relationships to take each other down with the battle cry: “You’re It!” This year, the game coincides with the wedding of their only undefeated player, which should finally make him an easy target. However, he knows they are coming, and he is ready! Based on a true story, the New Line Cinema comedy “Tag” shows how far some guys will go to be the last man standing. “Tag” is directed by Jeff Tomsic (Comedy Central’s “Broad City”), with a starring ensemble cast led by Ed Helms (The “Hangover” movies, “We’re the Millers”), Jake Johnson (TV’s “New Girl”), Annabelle Wallis (“The Mummy”), Rashida Jones (TV’s “Parks and Recreation”), Isla Fisher (“Now You See Me”), Leslie Bibb (“Iron Man 2”), Hannibal Buress (“Neighbors”), with Jon Hamm (“Baby Driver,” TV’s “Mad Men”) and Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner (“The Hurt Locker, “The Town”). The “Tag” screenplay was written by Rob McKittrick (“Waiting”) and Mark Steilen (TV’s “Mozart in the Jungle”), screen story by Mark Steilen, and based on the Wall Street Journal article entitled “It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being It,” by Russell Adams. Todd Garner and Mark Steilen produced the film, with Hans Ritter, Richard Brener, Walter Hamada and Dave Neustadter serving as executive producers. Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, will distribute “Tag”. .“Tag” will be out in Filmhouse Cinemas 29th June 2018.
