A source monitoring the deal told The Guardian yesterday that the meeting would likely continue today in Abuja. The transaction for the takeover of 9Mobile was supposed to have been concluded yesterday, which happened to be the last day of the 90-days handed Teleology Holdings, which emerged the preferred bidder, to complete payment for the embattled telecommunications firm. Teleology was supposed to pay the remaining $251 million on July 25, after paying the first $50 million non-refundable fee on March 21. The firm was said to have kept the $251 million in an escrow account waiting for regulatory approval on the deal before final payment. Sources claimed Teleology was given an extension of 20-days to sort out every other issue around the deal.
