The 38-year old goalkeeper signed a one-year deal. “It has been a pretty dramatic time for me and I can’t wait to get started. I am absolutely delighted and it is a thrill and an honour to be here,” Green told Chelsea’s official club website. The goalkeeper, although, did not play a single game at Huddersfield Town last season, has a wealth of Premier League appearance, having played for Norwich City, West Ham and Queens Park Rangers in the top flight. Green’s last competitive appearance came in last season’s Carabao Cup for Leeds United as the Championship outfit downed Newport County 5-1 in August 2017. He will provide cover for Thibaut Courtois and Willy Caballero. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
