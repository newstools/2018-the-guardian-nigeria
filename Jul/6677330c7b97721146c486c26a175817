 Kings College  This would be followed by an official launch of all three projects donated to the college by our class.
 
“Recall that due to inadequacies of the school’s waste disposal system designed for a far smaller population, the Class of 88, last year raised and deployed N15 million for the redesign and refurbishment of the waste management facility. The project, funded by the class and in commemoration of our 30th anniversary graduation from the college, is one of the three to be launched during the celebrations.”
 
Another member of the committee, Emeka Oragwu, said there would be a live performance of Dike Chukwumerije’s “Made in Nigeria” – a 120-minute depiction of 102 years of Nigeria’s history through poetry, dance and drama at the school’s assembly hall.
