Twitter is a popular social media platform that is used to express views. It is also used to get the latest gossip about celebrities and controversial people. The number of followers a user has is used for determining their popularity status.
Unfortunately for people who revel in their numbers, they are about to lose their followers. Twitter has announced that they are going to cancel some accounts that have been blocked by other users as disruptive and accounts that have not been active for a long time.  On the Twitter platform, the chief financial officer said, “We’re always going to do the right thing to make sure that the service is great for those that should be on it and that’s going to be removing spamming and suspicious accounts whenever we can and we continue to improve with that,” he said. Eventually, Twitter users who lose numbers will have the comfort of knowing that their followers are active humans, not robots or suspicious users.
