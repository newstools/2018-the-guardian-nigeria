Next up in the long list of TV shows anticipate is iconic action series 24 in the form of a prequel. According to Variety, Howard Gordon and co-creators Joel Surnow and Bob Cochran are reportedly in the process of developing a new version of the show at 20th Century Fox that will follow a young Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland). This will mark the third time Fox has looked to relaunch the franchise if it is successfully released. The original “24,” ran for eight seasons on Fox from 2002-2010. Fox then brought the show back with the limited series “24: Live Another Day” in 2014. Most recently, Corey Hawkins starred in “24: Legacy,” playing an entirely new character named Eric Carter. The project is in the early phases of development and It’s unclear when the series could be on the air, though there have been rumours in May that Fox could launch the new instalment for midseason. However, Casting has not begun.
