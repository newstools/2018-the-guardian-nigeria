It is the most important challenge they are gonna face.” Also Facebook Media Partnerships representative, Sarah Brown expressed optimism that participants will utilize skills learned during the training to maximally. “We hope they are confident of using our tools in the best way they can to cover events, engage their audience, developing periodic contents in a way that it will be thoughtful and engaging.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
