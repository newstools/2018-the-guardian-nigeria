Given the Hot Dog Day is an international event; the best way is to enjoy it is to serve yourself up a meal with hot dogs! Since It is the corn season our favourite is the Corniest Hot Dog. Ingredients Methods STEP 1: Put the bacon in a frying pan over medium heat until the bacon is crispy. STEP 2: Put the onions into the frying pan with bacon, season with a 1/2 tbsp of salt to draw out moisture and cook gently over medium heat until caramelized, about 20 minutes. STEP 3: Put 2 tbsp of oil in a hot pan. When the oil starts to smoke, add the corn kernels 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste. Stir frequently until corn starts to caramelize. STEP 4: Heat a grill to high. Grill hot dog until it is crispy. Brush lightly with hot sauce while still on the grill. Brush the inside of the buns with melted butter and arrange, butter side down, on the grill. Grill until lightly golden brown, about 30 seconds. STEP 5: Spread mayonnaise and mustard on each bun. Put the hot dogs into the buns and sprinkle a tbsp of onions. Top with a tbsp of bacon and 2 tbsp of corn mixture. Sprinkle each with 1/2 tbsp of cheese and a pinch of pepper. Squeeze a little lime on each hot dog and serve.
