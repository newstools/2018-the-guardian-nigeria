The candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the Ekiti governorship election Kayode Fayemi is in clear lead, the results published by the Independent National Electoral Commission show. INEC is yet to declare the winner. Fayemi won in 12 local government areas in the state, polling a total of 197, 459 votes out of 316, 019 total votes cast. The candidates of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party Kolapo Olusola and the current deputy governor of the state came in second with victory in four local governments. He got a total of 178, 114 votes. Largely peaceful, the election was marred by votes buying, names missing on voters list and financial inducement. Some card readers used malfunctioned leading to the rejection of many voters, including the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prof. Kolapo Olusola. Olusola was later recognised.
