He was promptly replaced with Mr Joshua Madaki from Jos East Constituency as the new Speaker of the State House of Assembly. Speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Azi described his removal as “part of legislative dynamism’’ that shapes democracy. “As we speak, I don’t have any regrets over my removal as speaker of Plateau State House of Assembly. “To me, the removal is just part of the legislative dynamism, which I should gladly accept as it helps in shaping our democracy.

On whether it was because he was a stumbling block to the House getting at Governor Simon Lalong, Azi said, “well, if that was the problem, they didn’t say so. “It is the same people that elected Lalong as governor, who also elected members to the House, and so I see no reason why they may want to get at him. “I don’t think anyone would want to plunge the state into any crisis; we are all trying to support the democratic system for due process to thrive for the sake of the peace of the state. “If they have anything against the governor, why won’t they seek amicable means of relaying it to him, than go after him? “All we want is peace on the Plateau not rancour,’’ Azi  said.
