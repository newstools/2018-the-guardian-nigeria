 Ikedi Ohakim  Okorocha said this while reacting to what he described as Ohakim’s derogatory comments against him during his declaration to re-contest again as governor of the state. In a statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, he faulted Ohakim’s claim that he would probe him if he comes back as governor. Berating Ohakim for his defeat in 2011, Okorocha said he (Ohakim) would continue to suffer electoral defeats in the state. He added that he would not have dignified Ohakim by responding to his comments but stated that it was an aberration for a former governor to want to rule again after he was defeated many years ago. “We would not dignify the former governor with a response, but to only remind him what he failed or refused to do while making the declaration. “It was an aberration for a former governor to declare to run for the position again without mentioning at least one or two achievements of the government he led for four years,” the statement reads. “Ohakim knows that nobody would have known that he declared for the 2019 governorship race if he didn’t mention Okorocha. He would have begun by probing himself for him to be taken serious. “He would have given the assurance that he would find out why he failed woefully in his first outing and what he did with more than N200 billion his government appropriated with nothing to show for it, including the N11 billion he purportedly spent on dredging Nworie River,” it added.
