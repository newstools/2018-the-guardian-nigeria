 SENATE CHAMBER DURING THE INAUGURATION OF THE 8TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN ABUJA ON TUESDAY (9/6/15).<br />3023/9/6/2015/CH/BJO/NAN  But the narrative of guilt is changing. We now believe that Saraki is a victim of official persecution. The events of that day targeted the Senate president and his deputy, Mr. Ekweremadu. We are told that the powers-that-be did not want the session of that day to hold. Saraki managed to find his way to the National Assembly and the rest they say his history. He not only outsmarted his foes with planting a decoy, he actually presided over the liquidation of the APC Empire in Senate! Through it all, he had a mischievously -victorious smile on his face. I suppose everyone must be wary of a man who retired his mentor-father from politics and took sides against his biological sister!   
   
Fifteen senators decamped from the ruling APC. While a good number berthed in PDP a few stragglers went elsewhere. One of them at the time of writing was still hanging on the road to nowhere. We are told also that one the senators from Kaduna turned out to be a snitch. For letting the cat out of the bag, he got a mighty handshake from the executive arm. The noxious spectacle was repeated in the House of Representatives where 37 honourable members jumped ship. The narrative is the same. Some governors are ready to move. Governor Ortom has dumped the APC and returned to his first love. Kwara State Governor will move soon. Governor Tambuwal has also crossed from APC. The APC under the leadership of President Buhari and Mr. Adams Oshiomhole is sinking. It is time to move on, they all seemed to say. Our minds flashed back to the gang up that pushed GEJ out of office. What happened in the house of sheep has happened in the house of goat.
