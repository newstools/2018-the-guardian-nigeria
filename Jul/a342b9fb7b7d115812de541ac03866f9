 Former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu  PHOTO: LADIDI LUCY ELUKPO  The former Governor alongside his former Commissioner for Finance, Jones Udeogu, and a company,  Slok Nigeria Limited, are facing charges for an alleged N3.2bn fraud. In a previous sitting by the defence counsel led by Awa Kalu,  SAN,  told the court that they had filed a no-case submission dated May 28, 2018 and adopted same as their written address. He further drew the attention of the court to Section 126 of the Evidence Act that states that every evidence must emanate from the eyewitness, who will give direct evidence. The defence counsel claims that that exhibits D14 and D1 were not signed by the maker (bank), but an officer of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. However, justice Muhammed of the federal high court sitting in Ikoyi dismissed the no-case application filed by Kalu, and says “You have explanations to make,” Kalu’s 39-count charge bordering on money laundering case has been adjourned to Sept 10.
