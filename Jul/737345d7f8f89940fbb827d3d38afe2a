The key Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.78 percent or 170.05 points to end at 21,546.99, while the broader Topix index was down 1.01 percent, or 17.05 points, at 1,676.20. The benchmark Nikkei dropped for the fourth straight day, ending at its lowest close since early April as Chinese stocks tumbled. “There is a strong sense of uncertainty with both the United States and China poised to impose additional tariffs” on each other’s products, said Okasan Online Securities chief strategist Yoshihiro Ito. The United States is due to begin enforcing tariffs Friday on more than $30 billion in Chinese imports as retribution for what Washington describes as Beijing’s theft of American technology and other unfair trade practices. Beijing has vowed to respond with its own tariffs immediately, which Trump has said will invite far steeper US counter-measures, potentially covering another $400 billion in Chinese goods.
