Adekunle Gold, alternative singer, gave a brilliant performance at the sold out #About30 concert held at London’s Indigo at the O2. He did not fail fans as he gave them, in his usual fashion, a night to remember. Bringing his heritage to stage, he thrilled the audience with the African culture including dances. I’m going to feel this way for the next 2 weeks or longer bruh! I Sold out O2 Indigo?!!! Nah, Thank you london. See you again, soon. — KING AG #ABOUT30 (@adekunleGOLD) July 1, 2018  His sister rendered an “oriki” while flanked by a Yoruba talking drummer. Check out pictures below:
