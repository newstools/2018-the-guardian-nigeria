But the new mother thought against it. She shared, “I thought that after giving birth to my daughter that six weeks would be enough time for me to recover mentally and physically. “I also thought that I’d be able to bring her with me on tour, but I think I underestimated this whole mommy thing. “Not only am I just not ready physically, I’m not ready to leave my baby behind since the doctors explained it’s not healthy for her to be on the road.” I hope you guys understand .This have been such a hard decision .I want to thank @brunomars for understanding .
