This is coming on the heels of the deepening face-off between the commission and Justice Muhammad Yahaya of the Kano State High Court. Besides, a coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs) in the state also kicked against Rimingado’s threat to arrest a Kano High Court judge, describing the development as unwarranted. Chairman, Kano branch of the NBA, Musa Abdullahi Lawan, while speaking with journalists, insisted that the association condemned Rimingado’s utterances, especially his disregard for Yahaya’s summon before the Kano High Court 18. He noted that chairman of the anti-graft agency’s failure to appear before the court was disregard for judicial process and was against the rule of law. His words: “Court orders must be obeyed, but instead of Rimingado to obey the court, he went to the press and started casting aspersions on the judge and the judiciary. We condemn this action and we are asking him to immediately withdraw his comments.” Addressing a press conference on behalf of coalition of 10 CSOs in Kano, Isyaku Ahmed, said the coalition supported the independence of the judiciary, legislative and executive. Meanwhile, Rimingado had expressed readiness to make himself available to police and appear before the court, adding nothing would deter him from discharging his responsibilities as chairman of the commission and he would spare nobody found culpable. Also, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has launched lower denomination notes under its new direct intervention scheme in Kano. Besides, the CBN cautioned members of the public against hoarding and selling f lower banknotes, a development it noted, was already causing scarcity of the legal tender. CBN’s Acting Director, Currency Operations, Mrs. Priscilla Eleje, who spoke at a Public Sensitisation and Enlightenment Campaign on the distribution of lower denominations at the Kurmi Market, argued that the new policy was targeted at easing shortage of the notes.
