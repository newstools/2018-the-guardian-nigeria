Senate President Bukola Saraki Nigeria’s Senate President Bukola Saraki has, after months of speculation, dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress. “I wish to inform Nigerians that, after extensive consultations, I have decided to take my leave of the All Progressives Congress,” Saraki said on Tuesday. He, however, did not say to which party he will be defecting. Saraki defected to the APC from the then ruling party People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in January 2014 along with ten other senators. Rumours of his defection have been rife since 2015 when he was elected as the president of Nigeria’s 8th Senate in a circumstance that the APC leadership found disturbing. More details later.
