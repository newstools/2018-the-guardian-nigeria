It was all about brilliant presentations by moguls in the media industry at the recent C3 Africa Networking Symposium held at Oriental Hotel on the July 22nd. Presentations were made by Sam Onyemelukwe, MD Trace Anglophone Africa, Ngozi Maduekewe-Dozie GM West Africa for KweseÂ Iflix and Mby Johnson, CEO of Basement Studios. These presentations centred around creating quality and interesting content that people will relate to and enjoy. C3 AFRICA is about creating value and opportunity for the film and TV industry, said Somto Ajuluchukwu, Director C3 Africa.
