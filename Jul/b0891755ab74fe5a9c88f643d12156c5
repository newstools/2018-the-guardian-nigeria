It’s the dreadful day of the year. What is it about the day that makes everyone cringe? The number, no matter how much one tries to dismiss it still brings fear whenever it is mentioned. Could it be a coincidence that All on Friday the 13th. As if we are not scared enough, the classic 1980 ‘Friday The 13th’ film lingers in our minds. It is said that Friday the 13th sprung out of the Christian ‘last supper meal’ where Judas Iscariot broke bread with Jesus before betraying him with a kiss to the chief priests and Pharisees. Since then, it has come to be known as an unlucky day. Friday the 13th. Photo credit: The Inquisitr We want to think that the 13th is not as bad as the rest of the world see it: Despite all of these, Italians regard this day as a lucky day and are filled with dread on Friday the 17th. The fact that there is no universal acceptance of the belief behind today means that we might just take the side of Science and settle with the idea that we have Triskaidekaphobia (the fear of the number 13) or worse, Paraskevidekatriaphobia/ Friggatriskaidekaphobia (the fear of Friday the 13th). By the way, it’s TGIF, remember? That said, we take no responsibility for what happens to you today.
