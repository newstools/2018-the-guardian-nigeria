PHOTO: FIFA.COM/Getty Images Time: 3:00pm Venue: Samara Arena Sweden are definitely the underdogs in the showdown at Samara against England. Noises about football’s homecoming were even more pronounced after England won their first penalty shootout ever in a World Cup in the round-of-16 tie against Colombia. However, the theme from the England camp going into this game has been about humility and focus. Certainly, the Three Lions have a different feel about them compared to the different iterations of the English side at the World Cup. Gareth Southgate has brilliantly shaped his side with belief and level-headedness progressing steadily as the games come. Sweden will have overachieved if they get into the semi-finals in place of the Three Lions. Janne Andersson’s charges have been defensively solid led by Andreas Granqvist and are effective on the counterattack. If the Swedes make it to the semi-finals it will be the first time since USA 1994 when they finished third. Possible line-ups
Sweden: Robin Olsen; Emil Krafth, Victor Lindelöf, Andreas Granqvist, Ludwig Augustinsson; Viktor Claesson, Sebastian Larsson, Albin Ekdal, Emil Forsberg; Marcus Berg, Ola Toivonen England: Jordan Pickford; Kyle Walker, John Stones, Harry Maguire; Kieran Trippier, Dele, Jordan Henderson, Jesse Lingard, Ashley Young; Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
