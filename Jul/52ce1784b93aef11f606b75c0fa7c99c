Photo: TWITTER/UcheSecondus The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its vested interests in government circles on the dangers of sponsoring protests against members of the National Assembly. The party remarked that such antics “are capable of destroying the bedrock of Nigeria’s democracy, pitching Nigerians against one another and driving our nation into anarchy.” In a statement, yesterday, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said “Nigerians were shocked over revelations in which cabinet ministers and appointees of the President were alleged to have paid the protesters with a view to using them to embarrass the National Assembly.” He recalled how in April this year, hoodlums gained access into the National Assembly, invaded the hallowed chambers of the Senate and made away with the mace, while threatening lawmakers and disrupting proceedings in the parliament. Consequently, the party stated: “Members of the National Assembly are direct representatives of the people and the failure of the Federal Government to recall Senator Dino Melaye, despite the huge resources invested, speaks volume of the real position of Nigerians on the ongoing stand-off between the executive and the legislature.” It cautioned the ruling party and its interests in the federal executive to end their plots against the National Assembly and direct such energies to providing good governance, which has eluded the nation in the last three years.
