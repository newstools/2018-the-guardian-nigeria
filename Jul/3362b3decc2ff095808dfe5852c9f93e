FRSC Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned driving schools involved in issuance of certificate without proper training of drivers to stop operations. The Corps Marshal Boboye Oyeyemi said this while addressing the joint body of Association of Driving School Operators of Nigeria (ACDSON) and the Association of Driving School Instructors of Nigeria (ADSIN) at a national workshop on driving schools in Imo State. Oyeyemi urged driving schools to be professional in their operations. He urged participants to use the opportunity to critically examine how they can find new ways of improving the quality of driver’s education and road safety in Nigeria. He stated that any driving school giving out half-baked driving lessons would be prosecuted. “Corps need the assistance and cooperation of all to succeed in the campaign by putting a firm check on this scourge threatening the security of lives and properties,” Boboye said. He said some driving schools have been “suspended from the portal for some time now due to sharp practices like illegally graduating trainees in less than the legally prescribed 26 mandatory hours, upload of vehicles in excess of the approved number to illegally increase intake. Oyeyemi added that “with the inspection committee to re-register cars already registered in other states, the corps would monitor illegal buy over or acquisition of registered driving school without formal transfer procedure approved by the Corps and many more.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
