Neymar / AFP PHOTO / Pascal GUYOT Brazil’s and Paris Saint-Germain striker, Neymar, has branded his country’s quarterfinal exit at the 2018 World Cup in Russia as “the saddest moment of his career.” The Selecao were seen as the favourites to triumph at this summer’s competition, and Neymar recovered from a broken foot to feature for the five-time winners in Russia. Brazil overcame Mexico in the round of 16, but then suffered a 1-2 defeat to Belgium in the quarterfinals of the competition on Friday. Neymar has admitted that “the pain is very great,” with the attacker claiming that “it is difficult to want to find the strength to want to play football again.” “I can say this is the saddest moment of my career,” Neymar wrote on his Instagram page. “The pain is very great because we knew we could get there. We knew we had the conditions to go further and make history. “It is difficult to want to find the strength to want to play football again, but I’m sure God will give me enough strength to face anything. “I’ll never stop thanking God, even in defeat, because I know that your way is much better than mine. Very happy to be part of this team, I am proud of all.” Neymar scored his 56th and 57th international goals during the tournament in Russia.
