According to the  organisers, instructors drawn across the country would be taught on the basic techniques of triathlon by renowned International Triathlon Union (ITU) facilitators. Speaking at the weekend, Franze Studer, ITU facilitator, stated that the world triathlon union decided to come to Nigeria to up grade Nigeria coaches on the tenets of the sport, to ensure Triathlon is spread to all the nooks and cranes of the country. “Africa and Nigeria coaches in triathlon have to be trained to meet international standard for the sport to grow in the country. The importance of the coaching course is teaching and raising the awareness of triathlon to Nigeria coaches who are interested in teaching triathlon to the younger generation at the grassroots level. “Swimming, athletes coaches and cycling coaches are here to gather more experience. At the end of the training, certificate would be given to the coaches as a starting point to coach at the domestic level. “Nigerian government and private bodies should assist to provide facilities for triathlon, which is the major bane of the development of the sport in the country,” he said.
