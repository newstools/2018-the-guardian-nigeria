 Dasuki  Dasuki is being prosecuted for the offence at the High Court of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The matter was adjourned the to dates in September and October 2018. When the suit filed against him by the Federal Government came up yesterday, counsel to Dasuki, Mr. Adeola Adedipe, raised objection against the continued trial of his client on the ground that the prosecution team led by Mr. Rotimi Jacobs has not complied with some provisions of the law. Adedipe, who held brief for Joseph Daudu (SAN) and Ahmed Raji (SAN), informed Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf that contrary to Section 379 of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, the prosecution has not made the list of exhibits available to Dasuki to enable him to prepare his defence in compliance with the law. Justice Baba Yusuf, who remarked that the process of law must be complied with in the interest of justice and fair play, agreed with Adedipeâ€™s objection and further said that any attempt to circumvent any section of the provision of the law can make nonsense of the trial in the end. The judge ordered that necessary processes be filed and served on parties before the returned dates. He therefore adjourned the trial to September 27 and 28 as well as October 8 and 9, 2018 for the continuation of trial.
