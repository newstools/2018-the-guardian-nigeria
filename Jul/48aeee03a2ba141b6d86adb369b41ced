Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode Determined to have quality leadership in the state that would make positive decisions that will affect lives of its citizens, Lagos State government has trained senior civil servants in high impact decision making process. The state governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, said this was to make them effective in making decisions that were rational, informed and useful in the change mantra embarked on by his administration. Speaking at a two-day training in Lagos, the governor said leaders were tasked with making decisions every day, adding that “as the state grows, decision making becomes more frequent and complicated, hence the need for this training that will boost high impactful decision making.” Ambode, represented by the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Dr. Benson Oke, stressed that the government, in recognition of the importance of the decision making duties of directors in the public service, approved a proposal to organise a workshop for director-level officers, to impact on other civil servants. He said: “Since the inauguration of this administration, almost every officer in the public service has been enrolled for at least one impactful and skill enhancing training. I am hopeful that the benefits derived at the end of this workshop will be transferred to the public service for the benefit of Lagosians.” The governor added that the ability to make effective decisions that were rational, informed and collaborative could reduce opportunity cost, while building a strong, organisational focus. He said to be effective in decision making, senior civil servants should follow these two rules: They should concentrate on the problem at hand and entertain all ideas and at the same time refrain from allowing civil servants to evaluate others.
