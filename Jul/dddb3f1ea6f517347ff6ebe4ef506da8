The name herbal tea is actually a misnomer. Originally, the name tea was reserved for products from the tea plant known as Camellia sinensis. It was therefore a name given to black, white, green and oolong teas. However, over the years, products from other plants, spices, flower, bark of stems and roots etc have become referred to as tea and the name has stuck. These products known as herbal teas have been found to be loaded with several medicinal benefits. Knowledge of these benefits is growing all over the world, even beyond Indian and Chinese traditional and ancient medicines. In this article, I hope to present herbal teas that will ensure good health if they are made regular in our diet and more. There are various ways of preparing herbal products so that the full potential of these products are realized. Today as we begin with herbal teas, I shall make mention of the way they are gotten from the herbs. Herbal teas are extracted from herbs by the simple process known as INFUSION. Infusion is the simplest form of herbal preparation. Indeed, if you know how to prepare a cup of tea, then you can carry out the process of infusion. All you have to do is put a teaspoon of the powder of the herb you want to prepare in a teapot. Pour a cup of boiling water into the teapot and cover it up. Let it sit (infuse or brew) for 10 minutes. Drink the tea as soon as it is ready; herbal teas are better drank hot. Types of herbal teas
