 INEC chairman Prof Mahmoud Yakubu  The governor made the call yesterday at a press briefing in Ado Ekiti. He alleged that Zakari is one of those coordinating the plot to rig the election in favour of Kayode Fayemi. He also called on the INEC chairman to watch the activities of his officers. According to Fayose, corps members, students of the Federal University, Oye Ekiti and Federal Polytechnic, Ado Ekiti, who were to serve as Presiding Officers (POs) and Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) would be replaced with APC members. He said: “Fayemi and other APC leaders have been meeting with these three INEC officials in Akure and Abuja, and are reporting directly to Zakari. “Furthermore, Fayemi’s ex-Chief Security Officer (CSO), Hakeem Abiola and his former ADC, Adeyemi Ajayi, have been assigned to coordinate the indiscriminate arrest of top functionaries of the state government and the bribery of some security officials.” But, fielding questions from journalists at an event in Ado Ekiti yesterday, Zakari debunked the allegation that she had been hired to rig the election. She challenged the governor and the PDP to back the allegations with evidence, saying it was impossible for an individual to rig an election.
