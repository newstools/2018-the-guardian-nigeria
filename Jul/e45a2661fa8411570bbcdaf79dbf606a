Canadian pop star Justin Bieber is engaged to US model Hailey Baldwin. Bieber and Baldwin only recently reunited, having dated in the past. The 24-year-old popped the question at a Bahamas resort, according to TMZ. His security staff reportedly asked restaurant patrons to put away their phones before the star proposed. Bieber’s father, Jeremy, posted a photo of his son on Instagram, saying he was “Excited for the next chapter”, while his mother Pattie Mallette expressed her excitement on Twitter. @justinbieber Proud is an understatement! Excited for the next chapter! A post shared by  Jeremy Bieber (@jeremybieber) on Jul 8, 2018 at 8:31am PDT
