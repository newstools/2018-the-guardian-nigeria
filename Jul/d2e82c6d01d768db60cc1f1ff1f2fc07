 Olusegun Obasanjo  The former president, who arrived the venue at about 4:50pm, only greeted PDP members and supporters who had converged to round off the familiarisation visit of a House of Representatives member and governorship aspirant, Oladipupo Adebutu. The entry of Obasanjo caused a stir as hundreds of party members loudly cheered him.Obasanjo, who spent less than five minutes at the venue, left with his aides in a convoy of vehicles.Addressing the PDP rally, Adebutu, who represents Remo Federal Constituency, urged Nigerians to brace up for the challenge of easing the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from power. He argued that the incumbent administration had failed the country in all ramifications. He, therefore, urged the people to collect their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) en masse in order to restore the nation on the path of good governance. Adebutu assured that the PDP would bring back good governance once the party returned to power.The Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, declared that the 2019 gubernatorial aspiration of Adebutu, the scion of Sir Kensington Adebutu family, could not be truncated by anyone.

He commended the lawmaker for his intervention in the provision of electricity transformers to several communities in Abeokuta.Noting that he blessed Adebutu’s aspiration for House of Representatives three years ago, the monarch stated that the lawmaker’s next political move would be a success. Adebutu had earlier solicited the blessing and support of the paramount ruler for his gubernatorial ambition.He said unless good governance is provided by the leadership at all levels, people in “exalted positions and wealth”will also be affected by consequences of bad governance.According to him, good governance would bring genuine growth and development to the people and curb corruption.
