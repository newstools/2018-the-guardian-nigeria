Bwalya said the occasion presented an opportunity for UNDP and its partner-the German government to celebrate the impact of their steadfast interventions aimed at ensuring community stability and economic prosperity for all inhabitants of the North East and the country in general. According to him: “Today’s event is the fourth in the series of capacity building programme for Civilian JTF and Vigilantes in the North East. This programme intends to empower and strengthen their skills and competences in leadership, civics and value reorientation, drug awareness, human rights, sexual and gender- based violence, conflict prevention and peace building. We are humbled by the feedbacks emanating from the previous participants and stakeholders in the region that attested to the fact that this capacity building is impacting positively on the service delivery of the civilian JTF and vigilantes in their states and communities.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
