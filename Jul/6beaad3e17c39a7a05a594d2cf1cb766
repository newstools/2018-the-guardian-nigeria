Uruguay’s forward Edinson Cavani runs on the pitch during the Russia 2018 World Cup round of 16 football match between Uruguay and Portugal at the Fisht Stadium in Sochi on June 30, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Adrian DENNIS / Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani has a painful calf swelling but not a muscle tear, the country’s football federation (FCF) said on Monday at Nizhny Novgorod in Russia. The federation said this piece of news has increased the player’s chances of being fit for Friday’s 2018 FIFA World Cup quarter-final match with France. Cavani scored two brilliant goals against Portugal in Uruguay’s 2-1 last 16 victory on Saturday, before limping off with the assistance of Cristiano Ronaldo. Now he is fighting for a full recovery so he can again lead the line with Luis Suarez against France in Nizhny Novgorod. A scan showed swelling in Cavani’s left calf muscle but no torn fibres, the FCF said in a statement. “The player remains in pain. He will continue to do individual work and rehabilitation. His evolution is being monitored,” it said. “The rest of the squad is fine.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
