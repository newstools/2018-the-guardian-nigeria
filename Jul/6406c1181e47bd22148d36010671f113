Ologbondiyan further accused APC of laying siege to “Ekiti State Assembly Complex last night without a formal request by the Speaker, the Clerk or the Sergeant-at-Arms, who is the chief security officer of the complex.” The opposition party warned the ruling party to desist from the alleged plots, claiming that APC is trying to cover up for suspected rigging of the just concluded gubernatorial election in the state. “PDP is aware that the plot is a desperate bid by the APC to rush into the Ekiti Government House to remove and tamper with documents and evidence confirming the rigging of the July 14 governorship election, ahead of the sitting of the election tribunal,” Ologbondiyan sated. The governorship election held on July 15 was marred by malpractices. The poll returned APC’s candidate and the former Minister of Mine and Steel Kayode Fayemi as the governor-elect of the state.
