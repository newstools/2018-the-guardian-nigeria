How can anyone forget “Becky with the good hair”, the very Becky who got involved in the affairs of The Carter family? Yes, that one. Amber Rose is claiming that she might know who “Becky” is after all. She revealed this during Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt’s podcast Make Speidi Famous Again. It started with Heidi’s question on if she has been invited to any “sexual dinner” to which she responded “No, but I’m down, though” Spencer then revealed, “I do know Gwyneth Paltrow has gone.” Rose responded to this said, “I definitely think Gwyneth Paltrow is like ‘Becky with the good hair,'” Amber replied. “I really feel like she’s the one that was f–king JAY-Z, right? They were like friends, and now you don’t see Gwyneth Paltrow with Beyonce anymore, and it just seems like she was the one that was f**king JAY-Z. And now Gwyneth lost her husband, but like, Beyonce’s still with Jay.” Meanwhile, Paltrow has denied the allegation and described it as “completely absurd and 100 percent false.” Just when the public was about to go back and forth on it, Rose tweeted: Bruh we were joking on a Podcast! Lol stop with the Clickbait! I have no information about anyone’s Personal Life. FOH Over to you, Bey!
