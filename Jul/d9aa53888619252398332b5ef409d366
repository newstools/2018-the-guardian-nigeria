We have to take deliberate steps to end these discrepancies and call in the Minister of State for Petroleum for further investigation.” However, Senator Rafiu Ibrahim urged the house to expand the list of persons to be investigated beyond the ,minister. “We are aware that the Minister of State cannot approve issues such as this. Let us expand the list of those to be called in for investigation.” said Senator Ibrahim.
