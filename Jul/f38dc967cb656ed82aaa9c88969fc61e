Nigeria’s ruling party All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged its members not to panic in spite of some of the party’s Senators and House of representative members defected to other opposition parties on Tuesday. “We urge our members to remain calm as we continue to work hard to position our party strongly for the next general elections,” the party secretary, APC’s spokesman Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi said in a statement on Tuesday. Abdullahi assures the party is still in control, therefore, members should not fidget over the development in the Senate and House of Representative. “APC remains in firm control of 25 states of the 36 states of the federation and maintains a clear majority in the federal House of Representatives and state assemblies,” Abdullahi said. “It would appear however that the individuals involved have different considerations beyond the grievances that they were willing to discuss and which our leaders were willing to address,” he added. The party chairman, Adams Oshiomole had said he has no fears and believed the party members defection ahead of the 2019 election would enable the party to concentrate on its campaigns.
