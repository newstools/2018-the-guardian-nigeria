 Suicide  Ogunwande, 27, was arraigned on a two-count charge of attempted suicide before Mr. Aro Lambo. Prosecuting Inspector Cyriacus Osuji said Ogunwande committed the offence on June 28 at about 1:30p.m. at Toll Gate, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, in Eti-Osa local government area. He also committed the same offence at about 11:30a.m. on Monday, in a cell at Maroko Police Station, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos. On both occasions Ogunwande tried to hang himself on the neck with a rope, the court heard. According to Osuji, the offences contravened Section 235 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Ogunwande pleaded guilty to the charge. Magistrate Lambo adjourned till July 3, to hear the facts of the case and for sentencing. A police source told newsmen that Ogunwande, from Osun State, dropped out at Junior Secondary School (JSS) 3 and worked as a wood loader for seven years before coming to Lagos on March 5, 2018 to seek greener pastures. He allegedly attempted suicide after finding it difficult to survive in Lagos, but was rescued by a Man O’ War, official, identified only as Omotayo. The source quoted Ogunwande as saying: “When I couldn’t get a job in Lagos, I decided to go back home to Osun State, but I had no money on me, and there was also no food for me to eat, so that was how I decided to take my life”. “I want to kill myself as there is nothing to show for being alive, life has no more meaning to me again.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
