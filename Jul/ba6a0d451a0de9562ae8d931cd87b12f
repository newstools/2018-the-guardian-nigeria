The All Progressive Congress( APC) has lost another top member as Hakeem Baba- Ahmed, the Chief of Staff to Senate President Bukola Saraki, dumped the party on Monday. Baba-Ahmed was the Kaduna State chairman of APC before his appointment as chief of staff to Saraki in 2017. While addressing journalists in Kaduna, Ahmed said he has sent a letter of withdrawal from APC to the party chairman in his ward. “This statement is to inform the public of my resignation from APC. I have sent a formal letter to this effect to the chairman of my ward,” he said. “This has been a very difficult decision, to leave a party I helped to form and made my humble contributions to put in power,” he said. Ahmed alleged that APC has derailed from its electoral expectations and that he would rather not be part of its failing administration. He said, “After three years, however, I need to say that the APC has grossly underperformed and has forfeited any claim to my loyalty and continue membership.” “I do not believe in all conscience, that it should be trusted and encouraged to continue to govern our great country beyond 2019.” He further stated that his decision was taken after due consultation with his Akida group in Kaduna. “It’s a decision taken after due consultations with Akida Group, a group that has predated my appointment as chief of staff to the President of the Senate” He said he wouldn’t be joining any party anytime soon and will only contribute to the development of the country in his best ways. Ahmed belongs to the Akida group in  APC, Kaduna. The group had threatened to leave the party earlier this year if its demands were not met. There is the possibility the party might lose more top members of the Akida group.   Senator Shehu Sani, who is also a member of the group, had also threatened to leave the APC and was once suspended by the party for anti-party activities.
