The rail which is 45.245km standard gauge rail line from Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport to the Abuja metro station is the first of its kind in West Africa. The project was flagged-off by former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 in an attempt to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The rail links 13 communities with 12 stations at the Abuja Metro, Stadium, Kukwaba 1 and 2, Wupa, Idu, Bassanjiwa, Airport, Gwagwa Dei-Dei, Kagini and Gbazango. “The completion of this very important project is a dream come true, and clearly demonstrates our administration’s commitment to the realization of critical infrastructural projects,” Buhari said on Thursday. Transportation Secretary of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Kayode Opeifa, had earlier expressed optimism that most of the transport gridlock in Abuja would soon disappear with the commissioning of the rail system. Opeifa disclosed that the project was financed through counterpart-funding with the China Export Import (Exim) Bank on the basis of 60 per cent from the Chinese and 40 per cent from the FCT administration.
