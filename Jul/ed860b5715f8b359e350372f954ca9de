Photograph: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty Images Liverpool have completed the signing of Alisson Becker for a world-record fee of 75m Euros (£66.9m) on a five-year deal. The deal is still subjected to the 25-year-old goalkeeper passing his medical at the premier league club. The Brazilian goalkeeper is scheduled to leave Rome within the hour and will undergo a medical with the Reds in the next few days. Alisson is set to become the most expensive goalkeeper in history, with Liverpool surpassing 53m euros paid by Juventus to Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001 and the Premier League record of 40m euros Manchester City paid Benfica for Ederson in June 2017. Alisson will become Jurgen Klopp’s fourth signing of the summer, joining fellow new arrivals Naby Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri at Anfield. The Brazil international featured at the World Cup in Russia and was part of the side that suffered a 7-6 aggregate defeat to Liverpool in the semi-finals of the Champions League last season. He made 49 appearances for Roma last season. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
