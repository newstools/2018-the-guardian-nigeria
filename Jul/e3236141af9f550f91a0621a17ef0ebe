Kumbi, the late OAP’s best friend, also tweeted that she had spoken to her the night before. She disclosed that there was no indication that she was going to die by suicide. Another friend, Banjo Taije, also reacted to her death. He wrote: “I lost a friend today. Her smile was priceless, so full of life. She had everyone’s back. As I stood at her graveside I could only imagine what she must have gone through. We chase fame, money and other things, only to realise that everything is just going to end with a three letter word R.I.P. so it’s up to us to make our days count. Let’s always take out time to check on our friend’s. There is a lot going on the inside, because we smile doesn’t mean we are really okay. Money isn’t everything, she was comfortable. Depression is real.
Rest in peace Oluwapelumi Orungbe. She was complete #Photographer #OAP” Orungbe left a message for her Twitter followers over a series of tweets where she wrote: “Lol I really need to go
Sigh
The bad energy that needs to stay far away…
