Ogunyemi said the official was knocked down by an LT commercial bus driving against traffic shortly after he had finished the day’s job and was heading  home. “The convoy of the Deputy Governor of Ogun State, Mrs Yetunde Onanuga, which coincidentally was on the road chased the fleeing driver. “Unfortunately, he jumped down and ran  into the  bush, abandoning his bus in the middle of the road,’’ Ogunyemi said. He said officials in the  deputy governor’s office took the victim to Ifo General Hospital, before he was later transferred to an undisclosed hospital  in Abeokuta for further treatment. According to Ogunyemi, the deputy governor also deposited some money for immediate commencement of  treatment. He, however, said Malik eventually died on  Thursday night, describing this as a terrible loss to TRACE and his  family. NAN reports that the deceased, who recently lost his mother, was survived by a wife, three children and aged father. The deceased, it was learnt, was  buried on Friday at his family house in Abeokuta according to Muslim rites. While commiserating with the family of deceased, Ogunyemi prayed  God to  grant the family the  fortitude to bear the loss. The TRACE boss warned  motorists to desist from driving against traffic, stressing that any  erring driver apprehended would face the full wrath of the law.
