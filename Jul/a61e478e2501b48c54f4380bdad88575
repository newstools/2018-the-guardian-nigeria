President of United Labour Congress (ULC), Joe Ajaero, has said any government that fails to protect its citizens’ lives and property has failed.Ajaero, at the weekend, called on government to demonstrate that the lives of Nigerian masses matter to it, by arresting some of the self-confessed killers.He stressed that the murderous Fulani herdsmen as represented by Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) must be arrested and prosecuted. Despite all promises by government to stem the continued slaughter of Nigerians, the gory events have accelerated rather than decelerate, while government watches helplessly, he noted.According to Ajaero, the refusal of the present administration to rejig the nation’s security apparatus and remove errant heads in the face of complete failure to halt the apparent ‘civil war’ in the country makes the government more complicit. His words: “We had thought that this would have been one of the measures aimed at restoring confidence and rebuilding trust, which would send the right signals of its intentions to resolve the security crisis. “The deepening crisis of political intolerance, debauchery and brigandry that have suddenly become prevalent in our body polity is highly condemnable.”Ajaero stressed that governance in Nigeria had been reduced to drama on daily basis, ridiculing the seriousness with which other nations attach importance to the welfare of their citizenry and the nation at large. Noting that Nigeria’s democracy remains very fragile and may not withstand the pressures on it by politicians, ULC strongly condemned the harassment, intimidation and hounding of opposition politicians, asking everyone to rise up to stop the apparent slide into anarchy. “Nigeria is a democracy, and the beauty of democracy is when all of its tenets are strictly observed by all parties, especially the principles of rule of law and separation of powers. Actions that threaten democracy have become preponderant and we are afraid that the nation may be thrown back to the years of dictatorship,” he added.
