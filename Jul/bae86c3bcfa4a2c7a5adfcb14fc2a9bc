Following its breakaway from Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress, the Reformed All Progressives Congress (rAPC) Monday held a meeting to sign a memorandum with some opposition parties ahead of the 2019 general elections. Reformed All Progressives Congress led by Buba Galadima announced its formation last week and is largely formed by members of the nPDP – a group of politicians who fell out with the country’s former ruling party on the eve of the last general elections – and defunct Congress for Progressive Change, the Reformed All Progressives Congress said the ruling party has fallen short of its campaign promises. Galadima met with leaders of opposition parties like the former ruling party Peoples Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party to sign the agreement aimed at ousting President Muhammadu Buhari. Others at the Monday meeting from the PDP include Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, a senator, Dino Melaye, and Akwa Ibom State governor Emmanuel Udom. While briefing Pressmen, a former senator and a chieftain of the PDP, Ben Obi, said the parties gathered to sign a memorandum for a coalition that will take over power in 2019 and ensure the defeat of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC. Obi said the 2019 election is a battle between light and darkness, saying the coalition is the light that has come to rescue Nigeria. He said the signing of the memorandum is a signal to the ruling APC and the international community that they are ready to take over power in 2019. More details later.
