Former Super Eagles coach, Chief Adegboye Onigbinde, has said the team failed to qualify for the second round of the ongoing Russia 2018 World Cup, because the team was not given the right tactical discipline. He noted that in modern football, all the players, including the goalkeeper, are trained to be defenders, midfielders and strikers so as to play like a unit, adding Rohr’s Eagles prosecuted their matches without adopting such tactics. The former FIFA instructor also noted that Nigerian football would continue to suffer, if nothing is done at the grassroots.Onigbinde said the country still has talents that could compete favourably with their foreign counterparts, if NFF had been working with the federation’s technical department to get players from the league and academies in a bid to groom and nurture them to stardom. “The Eagles did not perform well in Russia, because of individual tactical deficiency. I believe that the Eagles coach should have understood that there are different stages of marking, which the players were not instructed to do. “These made the Eagles concede careless goals in every game. In modern football, a coach works on his players to be fit on the pitch. The Eagles lacked this attribute. Most teams that are doing well at the World Cup are playing as a unit. “At 80, I don’t think I would still be a job seeker. So, people should not think I am saying any thing based on the fact that I need Eagles job,” Oningbinde said.He said, “Nigeria football needs total overhauling, because of maladministration. When former President Goodluck Jonathan said Nigeria needed to rest for two years to afford the country reorganise the game, I was delighted, now that there is crisis in the NFF, people are afraid of FIFA ban. For me, I think Nigeria still needs to stay clear from football activities to revamp the football system.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
