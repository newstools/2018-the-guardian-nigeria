Fueltrax standardises the acquisition, secure transfer, tracking and analysis of accurate, reliable fleet-wide performance data, thus reducing the challenges of marine vessel owners and charterers like International Oil Companies (IOCs), to have competitive advantage and ensure fuel security, assets maintenance and attain as much as 37 per cent total yearly savings on their operational cost. Sales Director, NCS, James Slaughter, who was in Nigeria to address the challenges faced by IOCs and marine vessel owners, said Fueltrax solution was developed to address fuel theft, inaccuracy in fuel measurement and efficiency of fuel consumption in marine business. Speaking about the technology solution and data generation, Slaughter said: â€œData has become the fastest growing tool more than anything else. Customers need data and analytics data in a digital era to evaluate and make smart business decisions. NCS, through its technology solution, generates data for marine vessel fuel management. The company uses technology in generating and analysing data, which measures the volume of contents passing through the fuel pipes, unlike what was obtainable in the days of old where the flow-metre was mechanically handled in a most tedious way.
