A statement watch always tops the list of fashion must-haves for any stylish lady. It not only helps compliment your overall look but it also helps us be on time. Wristwatches come in leather, metal chain or band. You can wear a leather watch for corporate events, chain watches for evening party and bracelet watches for a more casual outing. 2. Sunglasses
Sunglasses have become an essential fashion accessory in recent times for stylish females. They come in different shapes, colours and sizes. Sunglasses can save your day when you’re trying to hide puffy eyes. They can protect you when it’s too sunny outside or when you try to keep a low profile so people don’t recognise you. 3. Scarf
Scarves are multipurpose fashion accessories which can protect you from the blazing hot sunlight or a chilly wind. Scarves can be worn around the neck on a simple top, left to fall loosely on a tunic or wrapped around the head for a more trendy chick look. 4. Handbags
Bags are an important fashion item that comes in handy for numerous purposes. They range from handbags to sling bags, totes, backpacks, purses, clutches, and can be used for various occasions. 5. Fashion jewellery
The first thought that comes to mind when you hear accessories is jewellery. Different pieces of jewellery serve different purposes to create different looks. They come in different kinds and colours and can be made from gemstones, beads or other materials.
