As expected, Belgium coach Roberto Martinez made wholesale changes from the side that beat England 1-0 in the group stages. He reverted mainly to the same starting line-up that thrashed Tunisia 5-2, with Manchester City defender Kompany as the only new addition, in for Dedryck Boyata at centre-back. Striker Romelu Lukaku, who has scored four goals so far in Russia, returned to lead Belgium’s star-studded attack. Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne were restored in a powerful midfield after being rested against England. Japan coach Akira Nishino also revamped his starting line-up after the 1-0 defeat to Poland in the group stages. The team controversially ran down the clock to qualify at Senegal’s expense because of their superior fair-play record. Japan are bidding to reach the quarter-finals at a World Cup for the first time in their history.
