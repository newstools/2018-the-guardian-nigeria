Many vehicles have been forced to stay on the bridges for weeks, due to lack of loading bays in tank farms and oil companies. This has allegedly caused many businesses grounded, while property investments in and around Apapa and environs are reportedly under-valued. He affirmed that the gridlock is a “lingering problem caused by port reforms, road construction and activities generated by various tank farms” located in the area. This week thousands of trucks and tankers took over the busy Oshodi-Apapa Expressway inward Mile 2, with the queue stretched out for more than 4 kilometers. This has caused untold hardship for commuters. Apart from street traders, who are making brisk businesses out of the situation and some unscrupulous security agents, officials at the port and area boys, tanker drivers, commuters and residents have become victims. However, the CP who spoke at a town hall meeting at Apapa area of Lagos assured all that “in few weeks from now, they will heave a sigh of relief”, urging them to exercise a little more patience. “In no distant time, the traffic palaver will be permanently addressed as all hands are on deck to finding solution to the problem,” he said. Edgal said the police is in deliberation with other stakeholders from the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), NUPENG, Truck Drivers Union and the Shippers Council of Nigeria with a view to finding ways to ameliorate the traffic situation in Apapa and environs.
