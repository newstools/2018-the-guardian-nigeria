PHOTO: TONYE BAKARE While many are nursing fears of flooding in some areas of Lagos, the state Government on Monday assured residents, property owners and investors in its coastal areas of adequate protection and safety of life and property from ocean surge. The assurance was given by the State Commissioner for Waterfront Infrastructure Development, Dr. Babatunde Adejare, during an inspection tour of the Coastal Areas of Eti-Osa. Concerned communities are Okun Alpha Beach, Lafiaji, Owode and Okun-Ade. He said the area is witnessing heavy ocean surge due to the challenges posed by climate change and global warming around the world but the government is determined to tackle the challenges. Residents of Eti-Osa area of Lagos have often suffered loss of properties during the raining seasons which leaves the streets and houses flooded especially around May to September every year. But, Adejare noted that government has constructed 15 groynes from Goshen Estate to Alpha Beach to protect the shorelines and the construction is a continuous project subject to availability of funds until all the shorelines are protected. While imploring the Communities to protect government investment in their domain and also work together to beautify their beaches for tourist attraction, he urged them to fulfill their civic responsibility of paying their taxes promptly and accurately.
