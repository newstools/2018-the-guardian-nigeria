Imohimi Edgal Following a letter sent by armed robbers to residents of Igando, Egan, Akesan and Obadore communities in Lagos, the Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, has ordered his men to shoot at sight anyone found with firearms in the area at odd hours. Edgal, who stated this during an emergency security meeting and on-the-site visit to Igando yesterday, urged residents to warn their wards against loitering between 12midnight to 4:00a.m. in the area, saying anyone found outside within the restricted time would be arrested. The police boss also stated that a team of Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) would be deployed to intensify patrol at Obadore area, urging them to respond with firearms to any suspect in possession of arms at night. Speaking on other changes made to improve the security architecture in the area, Edgal said the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of Igando police station, has been removed, while a new officer who has understanding of the terrain have been redeployed to the area. In his words: “I have called this emergency meeting because of my style of policing which is community policing and safety partnership. I believe that if we have a security problem, we can solve it together. It has come to my notice that hoodlums are troubling this community. I am here to put in place measures to counter them. “I am here with a new DPO who will be charged with the responsibility of working with you so that we don’t have challenges. The new DPO will also send me the list of all policemen in Igando and I will make sure those that have spent up to three years will be transferred elsewhere.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
