 PHOTO: Nigerianbestforum  The classics, which was scheduled to hold on June 24 at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Samson Siasia Sports Complex in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, was postponed till further notice due to the World Cup tournament in Russia. While explaining reasons for the cancellation, Libata said in a statement that the postponement was due to the absence of major stakeholders, who went to Russia for the Mundial. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, the NWF scribe said the body was still waiting for a date for the championship. “I know the classics will hold soon. It will be very soon by the grace of God. Hopefully, may be towards the end of this month. “All the states that will be participating in the one-week event are already aware and are preparing well for the classics. We do not want to give a date that will be changed again,” he stated. Last month, the NWF president, Daniel Igali told The Guardian, “As it is now, we do not want to rush to announce another date, which we cannot guarantee. A meeting with the governor will set the tone for the authentic date. Except that happens I may not be able to give a specific date for the classic.“I think the best time the classics can now hold should be in September, which will equally give the wrestlers the opportunity to prepare well for the world championship qualifiers in Hungary later in October.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
