Buhari, on his official twitter handle, @MBUHARI, posted the congratulatory message on Tuesday night. The President said the nation was proud of their performance so far in the competition. The Women’s basketball team started their campaign in Spain with a loss against Australia but bounced back to a victory against Turkey. The win or bust fixture against Argentina played at the San Cristobal de la Laguna, Tenerife, started with a slim 19 -13 advantage to the D’Tigress in the first quarter. Despite the Argentines proving stiff opposition D’Tigress rode out to the much-needed win. The President said: “Congratulations to our women basketball team, D’Tigress, who today won their second game in the ongoing FIBA Women’s World Cup.
“We are proud of you, and of what you have accomplished so far.”  The Argentines, who before the match against Nigeria were defeated in their first two games against Turkey and Australia, showed some intent in the second quarter with a 16 – 13 edge over D’Tigress. However, in the final quarter D’Tigress kept their nerve to win 24 – 22. Nigeria will play Greece for a place in the quarter-final today by 2 p.m. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
