A team of respected jurors comprising celebrity musicians, A&R executives and producers has been carefully selected by the organizers to determine the winners.Speaking more about the project, Matthew Ebhodaghe noted that what sets MADE apart from the rest is its values, quality content, continuity, and sustainability. “We started out as a record label with our own artistes and now want more talents in Nigeria and the rest of Africa to benefit.” According to him, “The show’s target audience is between the age group of 13 – 45 years of age. Auditions will be held across various cities in Nigeria and three other African countries including South Africa, Ghana and Kenya. This will help create buzz and involve target audience from all regions.” Also speaking, Kanyinsola Doherty, Legal Counsel, Matt Westside said, “We hope to showcase the beauty of making music and produce and all-star music team. It was born out of the observation that in many cases, past winners of music reality shows are not able to carry on with their success in real life. We observed that only few of them have been able to make it.”The organization plans to roll out more information on registration details and venue for auditions for the benefit of would be participants.
