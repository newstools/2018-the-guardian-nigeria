A former Speaker of Osun State House of Assembly,  Adejare Bello, on Monday dumped Nigeria’s opposition party, People’s Democratic Party (PDP). “It is my sincere belief that some elements have hijacked the rudders of the ship of the party and changed its cause to an unknown path which I am not ready to take,” Bello in his resignation letter. Bello, who was the Minority Leader of the House of Assembly during the administration of Bisi Akande, said his letter of resignation of membership has been forwarded to the Osun PDP chairman through the party leaders at the ward and local government. He bought a governorship nomination and expression of interest form at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja to contest in the state forthcoming governorship election. He, however, withdrew from the primaries along seven other contestants. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
