His words: “The world over, there is a new world order out there, a new world order that requires a new type of leadership and a certain requirements for a president. “A new order that requires a president that is mobile, digital and that has capacity and can plan for its people that have a destination. Across the world, people are waiting for when this new world order will come to Nigeria and the new order has come.” He cautioned that Nigeria could not afford to make another mistake in voting a leader that would take the country back to the analog age next year. “We cannot afford to make the mistake. It is not just about voting out the All Progressives Congress (APC). It is about restoring Nigeria. “To do that, we need a capable president that knows what the issues are. Today we must develop this country and address the hunger and deprivation.” Speaking, Ayade commended Saraki for visiting the state, maintaining that he (Saraki) has the intellectual capacity to lead the country in 2019.
