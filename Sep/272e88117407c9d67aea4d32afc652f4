[FILE PHOTO] Ademola Adeleke Nigerian senator and candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Ademola Adeleke in the Osun State governorship poll said he will dance to the state’s government house after the September 22 Osun governorship election. Adeleke will need to defeat candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Adegboyega Oyetola who is backed by the incumbent Rauf Aregbesola to succeed him. But the PDP candidate, who spoke at a town hall meeting organised by Oduduwa Youth Development Initiative in Osun State, assured his supporters he will win the governorship election. “I will surely dance to the government house by winning all the local government areas in Osun State on Saturday,” Adeleke said. “I have been tagged ‘dancing senator’, but this shouldn’t be used against my personality because of everybody dances. Have you seen someone who doesn’t dance?” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
