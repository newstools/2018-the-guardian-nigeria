After being announced as a part of the Made in America Festival lineup, our very own star Davido performed on stage on the first day of the event. It held on 1 September 2018 at the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This comes days after Davido was sworn in as a national youth corps member in Lagos State. Davido is not the first Nigerian star to perform at the annual event. Last year’s festival saw Tiwa Savage, Maleek Berry and Wizkid on the list of performers, although the starboy didn’t perform.
