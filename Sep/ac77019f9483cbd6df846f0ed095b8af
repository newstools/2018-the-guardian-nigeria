 [File] Kaduna State.<br />PHOTO: Juju Films  The state announced the restriction on movement in the area after a fight by rival gangs a fortnight ago, which left two persons dead. Governor Nasir El-Rufai visited families of the victims following the violence in the two communities in Kaduna North Local Government Area and after condoling with them, announced the curfew to run between 7:00p.m. and 7:00a.m. It was later extended to 24 hours following a fresh attack by suspected gang members two days later. A visit by journalists yesterday to the troubled communities saw residents going about their normal businesses. As at 12noon yesterday, shops were opened, while buses and motorcycles were operating commuter services without hindrance. Some residents said they were going about their normal businesses because the crisis was since over. “Yes there is curfew, but as you can see we are not adhering to it because everybody is hungry,” Achi Magnus, a resident of Unguwar Yero, said. “We have to go out and get what to feed our families with. The government knows that it is the same youth they did not give work to do that are causing these problems. An idle mind is the devil’s workshop.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
