Lagos, Nigeria. Photo: GettyImage Married couples living in urban settings reported higher prevalence of domestic violence (DV) compared with those living in rural areas, Prof. Fatai Adesina Badru has reported. Badru, a sociology expert and professor at the University of Lagos said he came to this conclusion after carrying out a year-long survey on wife battering and sexual and domestic violence across the state. Presenting the lead paper at the annual symposium in commemoration of the domestic and sexual violence awareness month yesterday themed, ‘Securing the home against violence: Everyone’s responsibility’, he said violence in Nigerian homes must never be accepted or excused. Badru went on to reveal that abused children tend to develop mental and physical disorders, phobias, fears and personality disorders while abused women tend to suffer from spontaneous abortions, deafness, contusion or/and brain injury as well as physical and mental problems. Also, the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT) confirmed that at least, five or more new cases of domestic violence are reported daily. Revealing that several factors contribute to domestic violence including poverty, unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, and poor health, the agency said it is not limited to impoverished or uneducated people alone as people in wealthy homes suffer from it too. Proffering solutions to the menace, Badru urged that principles of respect and value for everyone be reinforced by community leaders, social and sporting organisations as well as leaders of faith. “The entire education system must embody these principles and impart them to students at all levels. Integrated services including police and social workers must put heads together to enforce, support and render unconditional help to victims,” he said.
