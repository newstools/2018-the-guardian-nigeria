It is said that what happens within 5 minutes (or less) determines if a relationship dies or will continue. Hence, the importance of choosing your words wisely because they are like magic. While a lot of us are aware of this, the problem is some still find themselves tongue-tied when they meet their crush. Because of this, we tend to envy those who are able to start and carry on with a conversation. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-746601 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/black-man-whispers-to-laughing-woman-600x360.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/black-man-whispers-to-laughing-woman-600x360.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/black-man-whispers-to-laughing-woman-600x360-487x292.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/black-man-whispers-to-laughing-woman-600x360-320x192.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Unlike those in the tongue-tied group, they understand the effect of words and how to use it at the right time. Also, they know how to communicate importance to the person they are talking to. They don’t have to make things look more than they are by glossing situations or trying to impress people, they just know what to say. How they do it? Now that you have the basics at hand, get to the romantic and emotional part: Flirt: There is nothing wrong with sending signals that you find your partner attractive. A little wink, stare, close lean, laughter here and there and you have made an impression. You want them thinking about you after the conversation has ended. Plant ideas: You want them to know you like them, yes? Don’t come off too strong. Instead, plant ideas with your words. If he likes to play soccer? Let him know you like to bring on your A-game and love to be on top of things. He’d imagine you “on top of things” when you win. The point of this is, you want them to think you’re interesting enough to know better and you have set the pace for the chase game. Now that you know this, go on and become the royalty that you have always been. Want to know ten ways of saying you love them without saying it? Click here
