One of Nigeria’s biggest act, Davido was interviewed on the Breakfast show Power 105.1 hosted by Charlamagne Tha God and DJ Envy. Davido while telling of his journey into music, mentioned how his dad is a popular businessman: “My pops is a businessman that everyone knew him already.” “Is your dad a billionaire? I figured that because you got some chains saying thirty billion,” Charlamagne Tha God replied. He also said that his father sent him to America to prevent him from venturing into music but returned out of rebellion. During one of his performances, he says that his father sent about 50 policemen to arrest him, his girlfriend and his other friends. This period, he says, was about the time that Dami Duro came out. He said that the song received airplay and even the president and his father’s friends also loved him. Enjoy!
