Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations levelled against him as “fake news”. The allegations reported in German paper Der Spiegel state that the football star raped Kathryn Mayorga, a model turned teacher at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on the 13th of June, 2009. According to the lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, he had invited her and her friend to the penthouse suite ‘to enjoy the view of the Las Vegas Strip’ and raped her in the bathroom. “The plaintiff [Ms Mayorga] refused and stated she wanted to leave the hotel suite. Upon leaving the bathroom, Ronaldo pulled the plaintiff into a bedroom and on to a bed and attempted to engage in sexual intercourse. Plaintiff refused… and covered herself in an attempt to prevent sexual penetration.” After the incident, he allegedly said, “sorry, I’m usually a gentleman”. In response to this allegation, Ronaldo said in an Instagram video: “No, no, no, no, no. What they said today? Fake, fake news. They want to promote [themselves by using] my name. It’s normal. They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job. I am a happy man and all good.” His lawyer Christian Schertz has said that they will sue the paper Spiegel that reported the story while describing it as “blatantly illegal.”
