They won the first quarter by 19 to 13, lost the second by 13 to 16, lost the third by 18 to 19 and took the final quarter by 24 to 22. While Sarah Ogoke was the go to lady in the victory over Turkey, Promise Amukamara came to the party ready to match everything Argentina’s best lady, Mellisa Paola Gretter threw at Nigeria. Amukamara accounted for 16 points, two rebounds, two assists and three steals to Gretter’s 21 points, seven rebounds, four assists and one steal. With the game swinging forth and back, it was left for the coaches to bring their experience to bear and in Ottis Hughley, Nigeria had a manager ready to tweak the trends to suit D’Tigress’ quest for victory.  Even when the Argentines stormed back to reduce Nigeria’s lead to just one point in the third quarter, D’Tigress pegged them back in the final quarter to win the game by 75 points to 70.
