New York Fashion Week, one of the major fashion events in the world, was bursting with trends to come and trends to try this season. Instead of obsessing over the trends people will be wearing in six months, some of our street style fashionistas are already rocking these trends. Photo: Who What Wear Check out some of our favourite outfit trends from fashion week. Which of these style mix-and-match outfits would you rock? Dad sneakers are in right now and it’s time to start pairing them with a full statement dress. Look for a patterned dress with puffy sleeves and wear it with ease paired with chunky sneakers. Want to eat your cake and have it? If you’re running for an early meeting but intend to twirl afterwards, then one way to switch between both events is to wear a practical structured jacket over a prairie, full, more whimsical dress. This might be one of our favourite outfits yet. It’s time to invest in a pair of animal-print pants, in case you haven’t put one in your wardrobe yet. Go for a timeless, retro statement or 70s-inspired jacket or tone it down and go rockstar with a more classic leather jacket instead. Out with regular jumpsuits and in with boilersuits. Throw on this comfortable, versatile one-piece-wonder with sleek pumps to add a touch of sophistication to your look. Photo: Who What Wear You can never go wrong with a floral midi dress and combat boots. In the spirit of rocking frilly pieces with edgy accessories, pair a soft midi dress with hard boots for an edgy, chic look.
