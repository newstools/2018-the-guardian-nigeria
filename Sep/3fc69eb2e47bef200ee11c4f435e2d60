To take away a people’s history is to take away their power. Ethnicity and Identity politics are growing trends which threaten the ideal of the modern state today. Fragmenting communities and putting up walls. In the years that have followed, it appears as though those histories and identities collapsed. This year’s Lights, Camera, AFRICA!!! Film Festival presents Who Do You Think You Are? a theme which seeks to facilitate interrogations of self and more reflective perspectives of our shared humanity. It is our thesis that self-knowledge – of history, of culture – situates, locates and informs communities, countries, and civilizations. With this year’s eighth edition, the festival focuses on a core aspect of its message – to
connect with issues that are rooted in the African experience. The Film Festival, hosted by Lala Akindoju, opens on Friday, 28 September 2018 with a cocktail and Ema Edosio’s film, premiering for the first time in Nigeria, Kasala! On Saturday and Sunday, a wide range of films from all over the world will be screened to entertain, educate and ignite conversations. Films screening at Lights Camera Africa
