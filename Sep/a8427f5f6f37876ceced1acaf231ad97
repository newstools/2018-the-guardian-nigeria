A former member of the House of Representatives, Olumide Osoba, has alleged that some unknown persons were threatening his life and that of his immediate family.
Olumide, son of former Ogun State Governor, Olusegun Osoba, raised the alarm in a statement yesterday in Abeokuta. He said he has been receiving threats since he released a statement condemning the alleged ‘consensus list’ in which he was listed as one of the consensus candidates of the Ogun State All Progressives Congress (APC). He, however, insisted that his position that candidates for the 2019 elections should be chosen through direct primaries as ordered by the National Working Committee (NWC) remains sacrosanct. “Threatening my life or that of my family members is not the way out but obedience to the party’s lawful directive and policy. “I stand by my earlier Press Statement that I only support direct primary as ordered by the NWC of our party,” he stated.
