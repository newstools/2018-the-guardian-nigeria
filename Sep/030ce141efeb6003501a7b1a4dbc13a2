The Six-man Elders Stakeholders Reconciliation Committee, led by Colonel Abdulmumini Aminu (rtd), which was put in place to proffer solution to the lingering crisis rocking the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has recommended among others, the removal of election year so that it does not coincide with the World Cup. While submitting its report to the Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung, the Committee also cited the need to urgently establish an independent tribunal for football in accordance with Article 1 of the NFF Statutes of 2010. Other recommendations include democratising the process of bringing on board, critical stakeholders in the administration of football in Nigeria, to ensure inclusiveness in the administration of football at all levels, a total overhaul and restructure of football administration in the areas of an entity solely in charge of football viz-a-viz the proposed Bill at the National Assembly and interface with FIFA with a view to understanding our peculiarities. According to Col Aminu, these and other recommendations contained in the report would bring a lasting solution to the incessant crisis in the football house. The Committee that comprised the former Nigeria Football Association (NFA) Chairman, Alhaji Ibrahim Galadima, Anthony Kojo Williams, Professor Onje Gye-Wado, Dr Sam Sam Jaja and former NFF General Secretary, Bolaji Ojo-Oba, however noted that the leadership crisis in the Football House started ominously in 1999, and has continued to manifest in different forms and degree, culminating in the present regrettable and avoidable situation. Believing that there would be sufficient commitment and political will to implement the report, Col Aminu said the Committee had made far reaching recommendations with a view to providing lasting and credible solutions so as to forestall the future leadership crisis in the NFF and hopefully to re-establish inclusiveness and provide the basis for the effective football development that will generate podium performance. According to Aminu, lots of legal issues were involved and had to go through lots of legal documents. “Football is a critical area even in developed nations, it is no more a mere entertainment. It is a money spinning venture, and if properly handled, it earn a lot of revenue for the country and enhance the economy. But the way it is being handled, it might bring problems unless we resolve all the crisis and then remove administrative problem, we cannot go anywhere,” Colonel Aminu told journalists after he submitting the report. While receiving the report, Dalung said the government would immediately put in place machinery to implement the recommendations in the report. “Every recommendation would be given due consideration for the interest of Nigerians. We cannot gamble with the report.” Dalung said. “The crisis in our football has scuttled the development. We have been playing football but has not been growing in football.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
