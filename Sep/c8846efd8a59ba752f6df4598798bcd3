This was contained in a communiqué issued at end of its meeting in Akure yesterday. The communiqué signed by Ondo NUP chairman, Chief Raphael Adetuwo, revealed that 42 years unpaid entitlements had subjected the senior citizens to untold hardship in the state. Adetuwo premised the outcry on the recent directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to governors on payment of salaries and pensions, adding that old age hazards and poverty “are bitter experiences.” Disclosing that the pensioners were yet to be paid five months pension and gratuity since 2012, he said that the 33 per cent pension increase had not been approved by the state government since 2014.
