Tambuwal, who is also the incumbent governor of Sokoto State, said this yesterday, while addressing Benue State delegates to the PDP national convention in Makurdi, the state capital. He explained that he has full understanding of the complexity of Nigeria’s unique diversity through his experience, exposure and broad worldview, having visited and interacted with Nigerians in all the 360 federal constituencies as Speaker. He said the experience of last three years has shown that the country needs a leader that has the ability, understanding and willingness to unify Nigeria and bring back peace and progress. “Nigeria has never been this polarised along ethnic and religious lines and we must say no to clannishness. Nigeria belongs to all of us and every one of us here has the right to live and prosper in any part of the country without fear,” he said. Alluding to recent killings in the state, the presidential hopeful called on Tarabans to “stand with me to enthrone a government that will protect every citizens of our beloved country through better national security architecture. We shall restore normalcy, recreate the well known business friendly environment of Jalingo, so that the good people of Taraba State can have back their thriving economy.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
