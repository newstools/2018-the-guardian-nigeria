The Benue State Government has refuted allegations that sacked political appointees loyal to Senator George Akume are being witch-hunted through recovery of official vehicles. Special Adviser to the Benue State Governor on Security Matters, Col. Paul Hembah (rtd), who made the rebuttal yesterday during an interview with newsmen at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi, said that following the disengagement of some government appointees by Governor Ortom several months ago, a task force headed by him was set up to recover government vehicles from them. He said: “The affected persons were duly communicated through letters, phone calls and text messages to willingly return government vehicles in their custody.” He said those alleging witch-hunting were out for mischief and to score cheap political points.
