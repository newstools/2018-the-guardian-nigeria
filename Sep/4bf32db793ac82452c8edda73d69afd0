Araraume All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) governorship aspirant in Imo State, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, has promised to support whoever emerges the party’s candidate through a credible primary, should he lose. Speaking yesterday at the party’s secretariat in Imo, he added that if he got the ticket and eventually won the governorship in 2019, he would replicate in Imo the achievements of the APGA-led government in Anambra State. Araraume further reiterated his commitment to good governance, adding that he would pay pensioners as and when due and provide enabling environment for job creation. Decrying the high level of injustice in his former party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), he assured that no Imolite would suffer injustice in his administration. The governorship hopeful therefore urged the leadership of APGA to ensure a level-playing ground in the selection of candidates, as it would make the party come out stronger to win elections without rancour or acrimony. Following earlier complaints of insufficient party membership cards as a result of the entry of Destiny Organisation members, Araraume donated N10 million for the printing of more cards and additional N12.6 million for sundry expenses towards primary. Imo APGA chairman, Peter Ezeobi, expressed delight having Araraume in the party, disclosing that the party had wished to welcome the senator long ago. He reaffirmed the party’s resolve to ensure a level-playing ground for all the aspirants. “On behalf of the expanded executive, I promise you free and fair primaries. I am very impressed by the formidable structure of Senator Ifeanyi Araraume and I believe that with such a structure coming into our great party, APGA’s victory is assured,” the chairman stated.
