Former Super Eagles goalkeepers’ trainer, Ike Shorunmu believes the players should not use playing on artificial turf as an excuse to fail in today’s AFCON qualifier against Seychelles. He also adds that the invited foreign-based players should have acquired the confidence to face any challenge they meet in the qualifiers before accepting invitation for the game and embarking on the journey to Seychelles. Shorunmu believes the Super Eagles have the potential to win the qualifier based on the number of experienced and exposed players in the team. The one-time Eagles’ goalkeeper advises the players to give all they have to overcome their opponents today, saying that victory against Seychelles will put Nigeria on the right track to the Cameroun 2019 AFCON. Shorunmu advised the Super Eagles to be relaxed in the game to avoid mistakes that could mar their chances of picking the three points away from home. He also advises the Eagles’ handlers to select the best players without sentiment, stressing that the must win encounter would also boost Nigeria’s image in global football.“The players are well exposed in Europe and know the challenges they will playing on African soil in the qualifiers. “In my active days, before embarking on a national team journey, l always had at the back of my mind that I win a game no matter the odds. I believe these players are experienced and will be able to give their best on the artificial tuff. “I believe that in the team’s training sessions for the past one week, the coach must have penciled down the best players on the artificial pitch. Rohr has 23 players to select from, so I see no reason why the best cannot be selected for the qualifier.“A player who is ready to give his best for the country should also be ready to sacrifice anything for victory,” he said.
