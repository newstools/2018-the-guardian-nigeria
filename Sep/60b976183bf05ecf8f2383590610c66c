 One of Edozie’s paintings titled, ‘The Last Consignment To Lampedusa’  He depicts such in a sculpture titled ‘Ikpokuchi’ (calling on God), as it captures intending “migrants who patronise spiritual and worship centres before traveling out of the country”. He traces the problem back to the Slave Trade era. “It was self-slavery for selling ourselves from then till now”.
	 
However, Edozie also leans towards spiritual solutions to resolve the issue of 21 century slavery confronting black Africans. “The solutions is to say ‘sorry’ to those sold out as slaves” during the era of transatlantic slave trade.
   
Edozie agrees that leadership across political and communal levels have failed the people. He explains this much in quite a number of sculptures. Among such is a huge size titled ‘Obinka’, which recalls his childhood days in eastern Nigeria.
   
He notes that human relations across ethnic divides, which he grew up with, has been lost over the decades. 
   
‘Obinka’ is about “a tailor known as Ade, a Yoruba man we all loved as a child in the East,” he recalls, adding, “any cloth made by Ade makes one happy, though the designs were always Yoruba, we wore them with pride.”
   
Based in Lagos, Edozie’s last solo show, ‘Shifting the Paradigm’, was hosted by the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, Florida.
