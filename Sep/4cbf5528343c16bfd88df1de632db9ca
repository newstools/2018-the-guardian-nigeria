Recently, Google published the list of the most searched names in Nigeria. This shows that the change in technology has no effect whatsoever on people’s taste or appeal. A lot of people will find it surprising to see some names make the first 10 most searched people in Nigeria since 2008: Number 10: Phyno <img class="aligncenter wp-image-708654 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="719" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-974x547.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Phyno-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The name at number 10 is Phyno and yes some people are going, huh?!!! But he made the list of people most searched for.
Phyno is an indigenous rap artist who was not popular in 2008 despite being featured in Mr Raw’s (formerly known as Niggaraw) ‘Odi Ok’. But people perhaps find interesting his drive to take the Igbo rap into the mainstream making people accept the genre so much so that the likes of Olamide, International star Wale, Davido have had successful collaborations with him. Because of his unique rap style, other non-Igbo rap artist adopt some Igbo slangs in their songs. He was also the ambassador for the Guinness ‘Made of Black’ advert.
