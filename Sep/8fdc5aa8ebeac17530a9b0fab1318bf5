John Obuh Former Flying Eagles coach, John Obuh has called on the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to reorganise the football league and ensure it meets international standard. Obuh noted that the NFF in the past concentrated on making the Super Eagles more successful in the international arena without focusing on developing the domestic league. He argued that the disregard for the Nigerian league has forced Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr to pay more attention overseas-based players for national team assignment. According to Obuh, the NFF board should work with grassroots coaches to discover the country’s abundant talents, who have no platform to hone their skills. He also believes an attractive league would lure more sponsors to domestic football. “The NFF board has done a good job by making Super Eagles a brand in the international scene, but they have to go further by developing the Nigerian league. “The neglect of the Nigerian league has affected the invitation of the domestic players for national assignment. The board has to look inwards to develop football at home. At the end of their tenure, the level of the development of the local clubs in the NPFL and NNL would be used to assess their performance in office,” he said. Obuh also applauded Enyimba of Aba for beating Rayon Sport of Rwanda 5-1 in the CAF Confederation Cup return leg game, saying the victory would give the team the confidence to qualify for the final of the African club championship.
