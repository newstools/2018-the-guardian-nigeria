 [FIL EPHOTO] Osinbajo at the flooding in Otuocha, Anambra State  Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, who briefed the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on the development, yesterday said Lokoja in Kogi State has recorded reduction of six centimetres in water levels over the past week. Lokoja, a flood prone metropolis is used as benchmark to determine the level of flooding in the country, as it receives rivers Benue and Niger and is usually the worst hit by floods. “I briefed FEC on the latest flood data. The water level in Lokoja had dropped by six centimetres and the water level in Lagdo dam in Cameroun is also going down. So, we think the worst is over and unless any unforeseen incident occurs, most of the flood waters will retreat from now on,” he said Addressing State House correspondents after the meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at Aso Rock Villa, Adamu said only an unexpected and unlikely surge in rainfall could reverse the receding water levels and floods at this time of the year. The Minister also announced that FEC approved augmentation of the contract sum for the construction of Cham Dam and irrigation scheme in Gombe State by N612 million, bringing the total sum to N1.44 billion. Other contracts approved by the FEC include the maintenance of the new 10storey­ headquarter building of the Economic an­d Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for N500 million; procurement of 700 computers N459m; and purchase of 15 utility ve­hicles for the Commission. Also, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Ibe Kachikwu, announced FEC’s approval of $64 million contract for the supply of power to communities around Escravos following the construction of a pipeline from the area to Warri.
