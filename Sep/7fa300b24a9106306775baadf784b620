England defender Harry Maguire has signed a new five-year contract with Leicester, the club announced on Sunday. The 25-year-old joined Leicester from Hull in 2017 and played every minute of their Premier League campaign last season before helping England reach the World Cup semi-finals. Maguire, reportedly the subject of interest from Manchester United during the recent transfer window, said on Leicester’s official website: “Ever since I came to this club, I’ve always reiterated how good they’ve been to me. “They gave me an opportunity to play in the Premier League and built a great platform for me to go and perform at the World Cup, so I thank them a lot. I owe them a lot and I’m looking forward to the future.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
