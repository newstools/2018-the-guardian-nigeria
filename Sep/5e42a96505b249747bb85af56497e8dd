A People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Osun state, Tope Elusogbon, said he was allegedly attacked by political thugs at Olode Garage in the ongoing supplementary election in the state. In an amateur video that was recorded today, the politician narrated how he was attacked by persons alleged to be political thugs. “I was singled out, I was hearing those people wearing white cap with the logo of Osun state on it, asking that they should attack the man wearing blue, and before I knew it they overwhelmed me and they were knocking my head with sticks and stones,” Elusogbo said. Elusogbo, who is also a lawyer, said he was attacked on his way to the capital of the state with some other voters to cast their vote in the Osogbo polling unit. He also stated in the video that he was invited by ChannelsTV reporter, Seun Okinbaloye, for an interview in the state capital prior to the attack. According to reports, there have been pockets of violence in some of the areas designated for the rerun of the governorship election after it was declared inconclusive last Saturday.
