A Federal High Court sitting in Makurdi has summoned Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and two commercial banks to appear before it over the recent freezing of Benue State government accounts. The two banks are United Bank for Africa (UBA) and Fidelity Bank. In the writ of summons issued to the defendants, the court asked the EFCC and the two banks to, within 30 days, state why they carried out their action of freezing Benue State Government accounts. The Benue State government, through the office of the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, is praying the court to declare that the anti-graft agency acted against the law when it directed the banks to freeze its accounts. It is also demanding a declaration by the court that by freezing the said accounts, the EFCC had denied it the right to operate and transact on the affected accounts. It, therefore, demanded N30,000,000,000 from the defendants as damages suffered during the periods the accounts were frozen. The case shall come up on October 8 this year for hearing.
