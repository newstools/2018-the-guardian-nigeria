REUTERS/Ola Lanre  Ahmed, who spoke at the seventh professorial inaugural lecture series of Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) on Tuesday in Kaduna, also said that over 200 well-known Islamic scholars had been killed by the insurgents between 2011 and 2015 when their activities went to the climax. In the lecture titled: “Boko Haram Since 2009: A Study in Security History,” he said: “There’s no doubt that Boko Haram and its activities can be traced to Islam but only as heretical and vicious sect inside the fold. “Boko Haram’s leadership has consistently been claiming this position and has tried severally to justify their Islam-ness by relying on textual and scriptural evidences that they often than not quote out of context and without the chains and justifications of revelation.” According to him, some of these proofs include kidnapping of girls and forcing them to change their religion while “Islam says let there be no compulsion in religion.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
