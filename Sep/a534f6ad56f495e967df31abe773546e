• Urges Residents Not To Panic, But Be Vigilant The Director General of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mr. Abass Idris, yesterday assured residents that there was no likelihood of earthquake within the territory and the country, following the earth tremor in Mpape and its environs on Thursday. Residents in the FCT were alarmed by the sudden shake of the earth in the affected areas, their first experience in many years, which instilled some fear in them, resulting in confusion about the real cause of the involuntary movement around them. While reacting to distress calls by residents, Idris in a statement he personally signed and made available to journalists in Abuja, said there was no cause for alarm, but charged residents to be calm, alert and be rest assured that the abnormal situation would soon be over. He said the earth-shaking around Mpape and some parts of Maitama District does not imply that the FCT and indeed the country was under the threat of earthquake, assuring that the agency was in firm control of the situation. He said: “We have been inundated with distress calls in our watchroom as a result of earth shaking happenings around Mpape and parts of Maitama District of the FCT. While appreciating the calls from the public, we in FEMA wish to state that the possible cause of the earth shaking might be as a result of earth tremor and that it’s a sign of seismic movement within the earth, which is caused by sudden breaks along a fault line, which results on sudden release of energy that makes the ground to shake. “We are urging all residents to calm down and be rest assured that the abnormal situation would soon stop.“The incident may be due to earth tremor, which is a sign of seismic movement within the earth that was caused by a sudden break along a fault line.“This sudden release of energy makes the ground to shake, which may be caused by stress in underground rocks and may be due to rock blasting and mining activities in the area. “When personnel of the agency interacted with residents of Mpappe and its environs, they gathered that this was not the first time the shaking has occurred, but has happened five years ago.”Idris appealed to residents of the affected area to remain calm, as the agency was doing all within its powers to bring the situation under control within the shortest time. He, however, stressed the need for residents to relocate to safer zones if living in a building during the tremor and to vacate their houses and take cover under desks or tables and hold tight until the shake is over.He also advised residents to stay away from windows and objects that were likely to fall and find a clear spot away from buildings, trees and power lines, adding: “If you are in the car, slow down and drive to a clear place, stay in the car until the shaking stops.” He said in case of emergency, residents should call the following toll free emergency numbers- 112 or 08188888766 and 08057224574 for prompt response.
