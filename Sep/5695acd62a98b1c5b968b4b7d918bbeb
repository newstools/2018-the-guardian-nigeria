The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has clarified the controversy surrounding the election result of Ayedaade Local Government Area.In a statement, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in Osun State, Olusegun Agbaje, insisted that the result sheet destroyed by Mutiu Salawu, the electoral officer for Ayedaade, contained the wrong figure. According to Agbaje, the electoral officer for Ayedaade, Mrs. Aderinoye Olukemi Alice, following the information she received from the Local Government Security Chief (LGSC) that there was an error on the Form EC 60 (E) INEC Publication of Result of Poll Poster pasted at the local government collation centre at St. Patrick Grammar School, Gbongan and after crosschecking the result sheet for the collation form EC 8C to confirm the information, called her staff, Mutiu Salawu, to remove the pasted EC 80 (E) poster with error and replace it with the correct one. “Mr. Mutiu Salawu, being a dutiful staffer, went to carry out the lawful instruction of his boss when he was accosted by a mob that manhandled him,” INEC said. Also in the statement, the electoral body gave an extended breakdown of the results, which showed that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) polled 9,836 votes instead of the 10,836 mistakenly recorded. The commission also expressed its displeasure with the media for the “repeated broadcast of the event maliciously without proper investigation”.“I want to reassure all stakeholders in the Osun governorship election that the present INEC under the leadership of Prof. Yakubu will never jeopardise the goodwill and credibility which the commission has attained in the conduct of elections in Nigeria,” Agbaje said.
