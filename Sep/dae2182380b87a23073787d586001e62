 Chairman, Caretaker Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi  Makarfi, a major PDP Presidential ticket contender debunked allegation that he was behind one of the party’s governorship aspirants in the state, Alhaji Isa Ashiru, following protest by the five aspirants. In a statement issued by the former governor’s Spokesman, Mallam Mukthar Sirajo, yesterday, he said “We wish to make it very clear that the distinguished senator has not anointed anybody. Senator Makarfi’s only preference is for the party to win all available positions in the forthcoming elections. “This is the more reason he encourages the coming together of all aspirants with a view to forging a common understanding that will pave way for a smooth and successful campaign for whoever eventually emerges as the party’s candidate. It will be a big boost if they are able to come to an agreement  so that they can save energy and resources to channel towards the general elections. “ Makarfi’s reaction came on the heels of the crisis that emerged in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Kaduna State at the weekend, as five governorship aspirants accused the party’s state Chairman, Felix Hassan Hyet of allegedly backing Alhaji Ashiru as the anointed candidate to flag PDP’s banner in 2019. Addressing a press conference on behalf of the aggrieved aspirants, the Forum’s Spokesman, Mallam Ahmed Maiyaki said the governorship aspirants “met, deliberated and took unanimous decisions for the love and progress of our party and the state. The Forum deems it a duty to intimate the national leadership of our great party, teeming party members, supporters and the general public of their concerns. “As democrats, the Forum insists that power must truly return to the people through open and transparent process anchored on internal democratic process in our great party.’ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
