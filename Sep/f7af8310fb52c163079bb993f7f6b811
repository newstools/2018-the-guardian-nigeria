Gets All Expenses Paid Trip To Russia 
A young Nigerian, Ugenyi Igbokwe’s video tagged Sustainable Development Goals, has fought off stiff competition from all over Africa to clinch first place in the Atoms Empowering Africa Youth Video Competition orgainsed by Rosatom in conjunction with African Young Generation in Nuclear (AYGN), South African Institute of Electrical Engineers (SAIEE) and South African Network for Nuclear Education Science and Technology (SAN NEST). An independent jury, who cast their votes to determine the winners, adjudged the video as ‘special’. Impressed with young Igbokwe’s exceptional effort and great attention to technical detail in the video, the judges had no choice but to declare him winner. The award ceremony will take place in Johannesburg on October 16, 2018. While the winner will travel to Russia on all expenses paid trip in late November 2018, the other top seven runner-ups will receive power banks and diplomas to appreciate their exceptional work and valiant efforts. In total, four teams from South Africa, Nigeria and Tanzania received the highest number of votes from both the jury and the public. During the award ceremony, there would be screening of winners’ videos and a lecture about the immense benefits of nuclear energy. The organisers will include the winners from outside South Africa into the ceremony via video link. Other winners include Veronica Kgabisang Gouws, Koketso Kgorinyane, Naomi Mokhine from South Africa; Harriet Mphaho and Thabo Mametja also from South Africa, while Sophia Abeid, George Davis Bilali and Suzane Constantine Mumba from Tanzania with Going Nuclear: Africa’s Energy Future were placed in third position. Runner ups to be awarded with a diploma and power banks include Irvine Lumumba and Grace Malele from Kenya, David Mwaka, Isaac Kiprotich and Donald Kemboi from Kenya and Clement Masele and Anaeli O. Kisanga from Tanzania. “I’m amazed by the quality and comprehensibility of all the videos shortlisted and have given the highest scores to six of seven of them,” said jury member Dr. Anthonie Cilliers, SAN-NEST National Coordinator. Dmitry Shornikov, CEO of Rosatom Central and Southern Africa told The Guardian, “We view education and youth development as priority. This Video Competition is in its fourth year now and is aimed at encouraging students do their research into various nuclear applications for peaceful use. We are happy to support youth empowerment through this competition and hope it allows more young people from Sub-Saharan African to research how atomic technologies can benefit all Africans.” The competition ran from June to September 2018 and young people were invited to research and make their videos about various nuclear technologies, their applications and benefits for Africa, post them online for a chance to win a week-long trip to Russia’s nuclear facilities and landmarks. The jury chose seven videos that were published on participants’ personal Facebook pages and collected the highest number of likes.
