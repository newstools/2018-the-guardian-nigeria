A man, 24-year-old Ayo Yusuf, who allegedly specialises in raping ladies by the roadside in Lagos streets after threatening them, has been arrested and docked. It was gathered that operatives of the Federal Special Anti Robbery Squad (FSARS), who had identified the place as a black spot, noticed what was happening and caught the suspect red-handed. The suspect was arrested after he accosted a lady by the roadside at Admiralty Way in Lekki area of Lagos, forced her to a corner armed with cutlass and had carnal knowledge of her. Police sources said the victim was returning from work in the evening when she was ambushed by the suspect who was said to have pointed a cutlass at her and dragged her to a corner. Yusuf, who confessed to the crime told the police that he was not an armed robber but normally use the cutlass found on him to harass and have sex with ladies at night. The police found him culpable and charged him before the Ogba Magistrates court for armed robbery and rape where he pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Mr. Christopher John, informed the court that it was also a case of armed robbery because the police recovered two cutlasses as exhibits, which he used to threaten victims into submission. Meanwhile, to enhance professionalism and ensure FSARS personnel act in line with international best practices, the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris in collaboration with the German Government has organised a two weeks training in Lagos for personnel of the unit across the federation. It would be recalled that the presidency had recently ordered for the reformation of the unit, which led to the IGP’s directive for a centralized FSARS with a Commissioner of Police overseeing its affairs, while it handles strictly anti-robbery and kidnapping cases. The training which focuses on how not to violate human rights of Nigerians and to deliver on their new mandate will be facilitated by experts from the German Foreign Office. Speaking at the inauguration of the training held at the Police College in Ikeja yesterday, IGP Idris said the training is a holistic approach to enhance the performance of 135 personnel comprising of commanders, team leaders and foot soldiers of FSARS. The IGP, who was represented by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of Training, DIG Emmanuel Inyang, said: “SARS was initially established to take charge of specific functions pertaining to crime prevention and control as well as to secure life and property, but their direct contact with members of the public has brought conflict, friction and perceived human rights abuses and the inherent complaints arising from the performance of their duties.” The GIZ Deputy Project Manager, Police Project Africa in Nigeria, Hartmut Zander, said the German Government had to step in to assist in the training of FSARS personnel due to some cases of the violation of human rights in the discharge of their duties.
