It revealed that consuming nine tablespoons of the oil each week, along with plenty of vegetables, fruit, fish and beans also boost men’s chances of a drug-free sex life into their seventies. The study, presented at the European Society of Cardiology conference in Munich, suggests a healthy diet in middle age could pave the way for an active drug-free love life well into their late 60s and 70s. Experts studied 670 men with an average age of 67 from the Greek island of Ikaria. As well as olive oil, they found men tended to be protected if their diet also contained about 13 portions of veg a week, six pieces of fruit, three servings of fish and two portions of beans The scientists believed this diet helps men maintain a healthy heart and clear blood vessels, which results in a good flow of blood to the groin. The cardiologists also found men who followed this diet had higher testosterone levels because they had lower levels of body fat, which can interfere with hormones. Study leader, Dr Christina Chrysohoou said: “Viagra does not improve something long-term, it can only give some short effect in order to have sexual capacity. This is a drug-free solution that allows men to keep their sexual function.” According to scientists, consuming more fruits, fishes, fewer sugary drinks and snacks, are the most important aspects of a Mediterranean diet. Others, they noted should be consumed more often include, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, meat, non-unsaturated fats. They noted that people should consume less of: saturated fats, like butter, red meat, processed foods, like juice and white bread, soda and sugar. Other diets that should be in moderation are, a glass of red wine The diet has a positive impact on the health of the aorta, a large artery that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body, Chrysohoou added. But Professor Mike Wyllie, one of the scientists who developed Viagra, believes men ‘just want to take a pill’ and ‘can’t be bothered to change their lifestyle’. Julie Ward, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘It’s no surprise the Mediterranean diet, which we know is beneficial to heart and circulatory health, might also benefit blood vessels elsewhere, and help men maintain healthy sexual function.’ Meanwhile, medical firms have long sought out ways to treat the problem – knowing an effective treatment could generate a fortune. Viagra sales soared earlier this year when restrictions were lifted to make them available over the counter – rising 60 per cent in the first three months after the rule change in March. But not all men respond to the drug, and many others dislike having to take a pill during romantic moments. Erectile dysfunction affects 52 percent of men aged between 40 and 70, but Chrysohoou said just 20 percent of the men she studied had erectile dysfunction – well below the 52 per cent expected in that age group. She noted that those who had the diet closest to the Mediterranean ideal were protected even further, adding that the key lies in the health of the aorta – a large artery that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. ‘What we found here is that the Med diet has a positive effect on aortic dilatation. It keeps your blood vessels healthy and helps men maintain sexual function, and in all of all of the med diet components, it is the olive oil that has a specific effect on aortic dilatation and sexual function as well,” she added.
