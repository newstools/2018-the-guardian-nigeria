Every relationship comes with its own irritations, offences and struggles, but these are not enough reasons to give up on people. Musician, Bob Marley once said: “The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for.” There will always be challenges in relationships. In fact, every relationship has its ups and downs. Anyone can give up, as it is the easiest thing in the world to do. As a relationship coach, I have closely and pitiably observed how people accidentally push love, bond and friendship away in the most unconscious of ways. We must ensure that we cut off fake people for real reasons, not real people for fake reasons. Someone said: “Not everyone you lose is a loss,” but the truth is losing some people can actually be a major loss in our lives. Though there are people we may need to give up to go up in life, but the most prevailing truth in every life-long relationship is that there are some specific people we must never give up on in life, as their presence is sacrosanct to our destiny fulfillment. Our major relationship problem is that we often make temporary people permanent, while we make permanent people temporary in our lives. True freedom is learning to detach yourself from people, places and perspectives that are no longer in tandem with your destination. When cutting off people from you, you must also realise that there are some special people that are instrumental to your success in life, people that are needed and sacrosanct to your destiny fulfillment. Sometimes, a relationship is like a house. When a light bulb burns out, you don’t go out and buy a new house; you fix the bulb. Never Give Up On People That Give You Sincere Feedbacks
A true friend will hurt you with the truth, but will never comfort you with a lie. Andy Stanley said: “Leaders who don’t listen will eventually be surrounded by people who have nothing to say.” Great people value feedbacks and criticism. Leaders who surround themselves with people that say only what they want to hear are headed for a journey into oblivion. A person that is beyond confrontation will self-destruct himself. Great people surround themselves, not only with people that say what they want to hear, but also people that say what they ought to hear. Criticisms and feedbacks are the lifelines of leadership. Never Give Up On People That Help You Find Humour In Every Situation
There is no greater source of natural tranquilizer as someone with whom you can laugh at anything. One of life’s greatest tragedies is being too serious always that we forget to play. Don’t ever take life too serious, as doing so is a recipe for continuous frustration. Someone once said that every time you find some humour in a difficult situation, you win. I have often told my mentees that there are three categories of people you must always surround yourself with (I call them the three Ps)- People you can PLAN with, people you can PRAY with and people you can PLAY with. If you can find these three in one person, then you are the luckiest on earth. Never Give Up On People Who Make Continual Improvement
Never give up on anyone who makes continual progress, no matter how slow. I have come to realise in relationships that it doesn’t matter how slow people go in improving on themselves, as long as it is continuous and consistent. Excellent people don’t necessarily pursue excellence; they believe in constant improvement, adjustment and change. Always encourage people to strive for continuous improvement, instead of perfection. Never Give Up On People Who Didn’t Give-Up On You
Zig Ziglar said: “A lot of people have gone further than they thought they could because someone else thought they could.” Even in the midst of your own personal doubt, there are some people that will never give up on you. They inspire you through their deep and tenacious belief in you. A true friend is one who comes in when the whole world has gone out. You must never give up on people that held your hands through difficult times. Never Give Up On People That Bring Out The Best In You
When the originator of modern automobile, Henry Ford, was asked to define what ‘best friend’ means to him, he said: “My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me.” Don’t ever give up on someone that challenges and stimulates you to be the best at all times. Never Give Up On People That Hold You Accountable
Sunday Adelaja said: “Where there is no accountability, there will also be no responsibility.” One of the core evidence of maturity is holding ourselves accountable. Don’t ever give up on your accountability partner. Costly and damaging mistakes can be avoided when we hold ourselves accountable to people that are more matured and experienced in our field of endeavours. Never Give Up On People That Support Your Dreams And Goals
Real enemies are not necessarily those that fight us physically; they are actually those that frustrate our dreams and goals.
You don’t know your enemies until you decide to pursue your dreams. Never give up on people that support your dreams; they are destiny helpers. Mark Twain said: “Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great. When you are seeking to bring big plans to fruition, it is important with whom you regularly associate. “Hang out with friends who are like-minded and who are also designing purpose-filled lives. Similarly, be that kind of a friend for your friends.” Never Give Up On People That Bring Positivity Into Your Life
How far you will go in the journey of life is a function of the positive energy and people around you. Don’t expect to see positive changes in your life if you surround yourself with negative people. Try spending more time around people that infuse positivity into you and affirm your worth. Never Give Up On Someone You Truly Love
Never give up on someone you truly love. The greatest tragedy of life is being with someone else while your heart is with another. Spend the rest of your life where your heart is. Don’t give up on someone with whom a day will never go by without thinking about. You may need to leave an unfulfilling relationship to get back your sanity and self-esteem, but never ever give up on love. When your heart constantly and truly goes out for somebody, never lose him/her. The Bible says: “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” Never Give Up On Yourself 
This last one is actually the most important of the 10; never give up on yourself. Giving up on your important goals is tantamount to giving up on yourself. You are a unique person with your own gifts and talents and no one will invest in them more than you. You may succeed when others give up on you, but you will never succeed if you give up on yourself. Learn to forgive yourself of your faults and mistakes and move on. Mel Robbins said: “There will always be someone who can’t see your worth. Don’t let it be you.” Get up. Dust off. Do something. Never ever lose faith in yourself; you are all that you have got. When the wrong people leave your life, the right things start to happen. When the right people leave your life, the wrong things start to happen. No matter what happens, never be too quick to cut off relationships. What has worked out between two people ultimately becomes stronger.
