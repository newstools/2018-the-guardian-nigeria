The President’s spokesman defined the turnout of millions of registered party members at all voting centres as proof that Buhari has an incomparable ability to reach out to people and mobilise votes. He further affirmed that Buhari’s victory has shown that “you don’t have to be a party owner or go through a difficult inner party consensus to emerge as candidate” Shehu, therefore, challenged all democratic parties in Nigeria to emulate the president’s form of leadership so as to acquire victory in their political endeavour.
