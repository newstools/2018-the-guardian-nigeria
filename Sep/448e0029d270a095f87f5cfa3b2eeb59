In response to the latest United Nations data, which reveals an increase of over six per cent in the number of girls out of school in just one year, Bridge International Academies (BIA), a tech based education provider has launched a new campaign called #GirlSuperPower. The campaign, according to BIA Nigeria Country Managing Director, Olu Babalola, will focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills for girls. According to him, STEM skills are traditionally gendered as ‘male’ subjects in many low and middle-income countries. It highlights how young girls in underprivileged communities are pursuing their dreams of becoming doctors, engineers and mathematicians, against the odds. She said the alarming revelation on the increasing number of out-of-school children; particularly girls prompted the project, thereby calling on the country’s policy makers and other stakeholders in the sector to prioritise the need for gender equality in education. BIA, she explained is a social enterprise that partners with families, governments and donors to provide life-changing, affordable education to low-income families in underserved communities. It has opened 63 academies, serving about 12,000 pupils in low-income communities in Lagos and Osun States. “Around 131 million girls worldwide are still out of school, and for them equality remains elusive. The UN reports show that the number of out of schoolgirls at primary level grew from 32 million in 2015 to 34 million in 2016. Girls usually have to overcome multiple hurdles to access the same learning opportunities as boys. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
