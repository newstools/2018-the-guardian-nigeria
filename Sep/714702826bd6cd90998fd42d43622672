Dr. Datti Baba-Ahmed is the founder of Baze University, Abuja and one of the presidential aspirants on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In this interview with LEO SOBECHI, he stressed that judging from the elections held so far and the way the Buhari administration is running the affairs of the country, next year’s election might not be free and fair. Do you think democracy has given Nigeria the much-expected dividends? 
In terms of social welfare and economic well-being, no. But, democracy as a concept has developed itself. The only thing is that it has not translated into the development of the country. What do you think about next year’s election?
There is no option it must hold, but whether it is going to be free and fair, we will live to witness that by the grace of God almighty. I don’t have that confidence that it would be credible from the way President Buhari and his people are running the affairs of the country and from the election we have seen so far. But there is no option, it must hold. It is a constitutional thing. Is it true that leadership has been devalued in the past three years?
Yes, the meaning of leadership has been changed by Buhari’s regime, it means that leaders do not really have to deliver on campaign promises, it only continues to manipulate the sentiments of the people. That is what we have seen from President Muhammadu Buhar’s administration. On many occasions you claim to have more integrity than Buhari, is there anything you know that other people don’t know?
Yes there are, but a time will come for that. If you are to guide Nigerian electorate, what are the crucial things they should look out for during leadership selection? 
They should search for the true meaning of credibility in an individual, the kind of life style s/he has lived, in the true sense of it not in the imagined or managed form of it. The electorate are responsible for themselves not to be deceived by clever politicians, they have to find out who is playing around with the people’s sentiment, they should identify religious bigots and do away with them, they should find out who is differentiating between the rich and the poor and disregard them. But given the levels of education in the country, do you think voters can come to that level of critical consciousness to differentiate between deceivers and serious-minded politicians?
This is where the problem is. The more you think people need to be distinctly educated is the more you encourage a common man to consider him/herself as not being capable. It is a simple matter of knowing left from right, right from wrong, black from white, night from day, it is as simple as that. If truly prices of basic foodstuffs have tripled in Buhari’s regime then you have your answers. If insecurity has heightened in Buhari’s regime you have your answers too. If Buhari has failed and he’s using anti-corruption to cover up his ineptitude, you have your answers. You don’t need to have a degree certificate or diploma to know these things I have mentioned. It is left for us to encourage the masses to know that education is different and political awareness is different. The critical issues are about development, by what parameters do you consider yourself as the best candidate? 
I have checked all constitutional, political and social criteria; if you pick any one of them to compare me with any candidate I tend to score more on those points. I have risen to a career and elective position to the level that the presidency is next. You will notice that in advanced democracies, senators are far higher than governors, but in Nigeria governors are richer and control delegates. Also, I have demonstrated capacity at developing Nigeria through my involvement in education and it is with education that you build countries. In my little way, in my life I have been able to contribute to the education of 11,000 people without federal might, with federal might I can contribute to the education of at least 110 million Nigerians. Last, but not the least, I don’t have any known corruption case, what you call baggage. I have never held any position in government or looted public fund. Zoning has become a moot issue, but people wonder if it is possible to get the best. Among the 12 or 14 presidential aspirants for the PDP ticket, on a close examination who do you consider is credible enough?
I would say only about two persons are credible to take governance and leadership to the next level among the presidential aspirants. On the issue of zoning and getting the best, it is possible to get the best from any part of the country.  What happens is that we should endeavour to respect the constitution the constitution, is supreme. Nobody should be excluded. If elected president, what are the first things you would do? 
I will unite the country, strengthen the naira and stabilise the economy and ensure that the killings stop immediately.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
