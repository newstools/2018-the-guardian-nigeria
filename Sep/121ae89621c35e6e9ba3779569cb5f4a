A man at the weekend lost his life in Kwara State when his family house collapsed on him. The sad incident occurred in Omoni village, one of the communities in the Ilorin emirate, Moro Local Government Area of the state. According to eyewitnesses’ accounts, the incident occurred when the man simply identified as Alhaji Garba, a septuagenarian, was sleeping in the house, a mud building, in the night. The man was said to be a taxi cab driver in Ilorin metropolis until about 10 years ago when he relocated to the community to engage in full-time farming. He was said to have sold his cab to garner enough money to carry out his decision to settle for farm business at the village. The building that collapsed on the man was the family house in the village where the deceased was allotted a room. He was said to be sleeping in the room alone when the wall of the room fell on him during a rainfall. It was said that part of the wall that fell on him was exactly of his size covering him from the head to toes. The man died on the spot after the wall collapsed while his body was brought to the family compound in Ilorin for burial. An eyewitness who was part of those that took the body to Ilorin for burial expressed surprise at the circumstances of the death. “I have never in my life witnessed a situation where a house wall would fall inward, I only know that wall falls outward. Again, I cannot understand why the fallen wall was exactly the size of the man,” he stated. Spokesman of the state police command, DSP Ajayi Okasanmi, said the command would promptly investigate the development. Meanwhile, an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court, on Monday remanded Chidi Christian (22) and Okoye Christian (44)‎ in prison over alleged armed robbery and possession of firearm. The defendants, whose addresses were unknown, are facing a two-count charge of armed robbery and possession of firearm. The prosecutor, Inspector Johnson Okunade, told the Court that the defendants committed the offence on September 18 in Ado-Ekiti. He alleged that Chidi Christian went to Ekiti State University, Female hostel and robbed some students, Olaniyi Elizabeth, Olawunmi Olajumoke, Alagbe  Oyinkansola and Oginni Oluwatoyin of their money. Okunade also alleged that firearm was found in the possession of the father, Okoye Christian‎. He said the offences contravened Section 1 (2) (a) and (b) and Section 3 of Robbery and Firearm Special Provision Act 2004. The prosecutor urged the Court to remand the defendants in prison pending legal advice from office of Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).
