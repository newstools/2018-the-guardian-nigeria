nter Milan’s Uruguayan midfielder Matias Vecino (Rear C) celebrates after scoring a last minute winning header during the UEFA Champions League group stage football match Inter Milan vs Tottenham on September 18, 2018 at the San Siro stadium in Milan. Andreas SOLARO / AFP A stunning Mauro Icardi volley sparked a stunning late Inter Milan comeback as the Italian side beat Tottenham 2-1 on their return to the Champions League after a seven-year absence on Tuesday. Christian Eriksen’s deflected strike gave Spurs a 53rd-minute lead at the San Siro, and the visitors looked comfortable for much of the second half. But Argentinian striker Icardi hammered home a magnificent volley in the 86th minute to draw Inter level, and Matias Vecino took advantage of some slack Tottenham defending at a corner to nod in a dramatic injury-time winner. The win leaves Inter second in the early Group B table, behind Barcelona on goal difference after the Catalan giants thrashed PSV Eindhoven 4-0 with a Lionel Messi hat-trick.
