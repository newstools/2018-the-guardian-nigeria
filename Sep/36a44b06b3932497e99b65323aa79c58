George Zimmerman allegedly has threatened Power couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z for filming “Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story,” in a series of text messages. Trayvon Martin is the 17-year-old black teenager he fatally shot after he claimed he looked suspicious for holding a bag of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea. The Blast disclosed that he referred to Beyonce as a “broke whore” and they would “find themselves inside a 13-foot gator” after he “beats” co-producer Jay Z. They report that Zimmerman was reached out to by Dennis Warren, an investigator who wanted to get facts from the people involved in the incident. They are not the only ones to receive threats from him. Co-producer Gasperro was also on the receiving end.
