 Gernot Rohr  Irked by Rohr’s omission of home-based players in the 24-man squad he chose for this weekend’s African Nations Cup qualifier against Seychelles, Laloko accused Rohr of harming Nigerian football by choosing only Europe-based in his team, arguing that players should be judged on their talents and not where they are based. “If he is sure of his players, he should pit them against Enyimba anywhere he likes. This team cannot beat Enyimba. “I want to advise the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to do a better job next time it wants to appoint coaches for the national team,” he said. The former Stationery Stores coach questioned Rohr’s competence, saying the coach was toeing the lazy path by not scouting for players from the Nigerian league. “I see Coach Rohr as someone who is lazy and not organised; he doesn’t know his job. I don’t see any reason why some of the NPFL players should not make his recent list of players for the AFCON qualifiers.“One of the ways to prepare our team for the future is to have some players from the national league in the senior national side. They should at least make up 25 per cent of the national team. “We really do not have any special player in that team who can make things happen. It is not just about assembling players… it is about inviting players that can deliver and do the job,” he said.On Victor Moses’ decision to retire from the national team, the former The Gambia coach said he was displeased with the player’s conduct. “I see no reason why Rohr should beg him to play for his country. That boy acted stupidly by retiring at 27. Who is he trying to impress? When others were busy preparing for the World Cup, he stayed back in England enjoying himself. What kind of indiscipline was that?” he queried. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
