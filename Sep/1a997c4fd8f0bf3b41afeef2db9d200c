Innoson Civil rights activists have urged the Federal Government to intervene in the dispute involving Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Limited (IVM) Group and GTbank, over lingering commercial disputes in order to protect indigenous industries. The activists said the call became necessary following the implication of the dispute on the big Nigerian brands and the overall nation’s economy. Addressing the media on behalf of the group in Lagos, former 2nd vice president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Monday Ubani, called on President Mohammadu Buhari and especially the National Economic Council under the leadership of the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) to step into the matter with a view to resolving the it. He expressed worries over lack of government’s support at the national and subnational levels of IVM, the first indigenous automotive industry by not patronizing the brand nor supporting it to grow. Ubani noted that in many other climes, the automobile industry enjoys a pride of place in the nation and is strongly supported by the
government because of its contribution to the economy. Also an activist, Liborous Oshoma said the call is more expedient because  the negative news are de-marketing the two big brands involved in the issue, which is negatively affecting the economy. According to him, Innoson Group is the only surviving tyre manufacturing plant in Nigeria, while the Innoson Technical and Industrial Company Limited is the largest plastic manufacturing plant in West Africa with over 10, 000 indirect workers and over 7, 300 direct employers.
