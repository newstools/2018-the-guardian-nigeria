The letter, which was made available to journalists at the party’s national secretariat yesterday in Abuja, drew attention of the two world leaders to President Muhammadu Buhari’s alleged brazen attack on the principle of rule of law.

The presidential hopeful said the ruling party “performed poorly” when put side by side with the PDP in terms of stewardship.Addressing the delegates to the PDP national convention yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, Atiku insisted that the party performed well when it ran the affairs of the country.He flayed the level of insecurity in the country, stating that it was worse than what obtained during the nation’s three-year civil war.
