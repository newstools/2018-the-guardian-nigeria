Country Editor at The Business Year (TBY) Nigeria, Silvia Lambiase, has called for an increased investment in the nation’s entertainment sector, given its impact in changing the country’s global image and its huge potential to bring major economic benefits. He described the sector as a vital piece of Nigeria’s economic puzzle. He also announced that in its fifth edition, TBY will dedicate a chapter to the entertainment sector to take a closer look at the fundamentals of the entertainment business and analyse what is needed to harness this potential. The Business Year (TBY) is a leading global media group specialising in economic resources and business intelligence across emerging and dynamic markets. In a statement, Lambiase noted that through appropriate policies, and given its far-reaching influence, entertainment is today one of the country’s main expressions of soft power, as well as country’s persuasive approach to international relations through its economic, cultural and media influence to gain positive attraction. According to him, in spite of the country’s many challenges, from piracy to a lack of industry structure, the nation’s entertainment and media sector will be the fastest growing in the world between 2017 and 2020. “One can only imagine the potential socio-economic impact of entertainment if more investment is spurred and the right policies are implemented. The government, too, has recognised it must take the entertainment business seriously if it is to diversify its revenue streams, and has therefore included entertainment as a top priority economic recovery and growth plan,” he said.
