 Chukwu  The elections are scheduled to hold on September 20 in Katsina. Speaking to The Guardian at the weekend, Chukwu said the kind of money involved in the election process would make it impossible for football management experts to get into the board, adding, “Everything in Nigeria is money, otherwise there are technocrats who can contest and win votes in the elections. “Now, people with little or no knowledge of football management are the ones contesting and winning positions on the board because they have the money to throw about. “Beginning from the sales of form, how many people can afford to buy it? Do you know how much they are selling the form for the president of the board and executive members? People like you and I cannot go close to it because we don’t have the wherewithal. And if we cannot afford it, that means we cannot contest.” The former Harambe Stars of Kenya coach advised those involved in the election to put the interest of the country above financial gains, saying anything otherwise will not advance the growth of football. “Those that have the voting power should be open, free and fair-minded. But the problem here is that only the states FA chairmen, secretaries, coaches’ association members, and few others are allowed to vote. “I look forward to a time when people that understand the management of the sport would come forward for election because they have the tools to champion the growth of football in the country. There presence will have a spill over effect on every facet of this nation’s life,” he stated.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
