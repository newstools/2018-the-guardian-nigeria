Top retired civil servants in Kebbi State under the aegis of Kebbi Development Forum (KDF), yesterday, attributed the state’s underdevelopment to poor leadership induced by lack of accountability from successive governments. The group’s Secretary-General, Usman Abubakar, said challenges confronting the state are aggravated by lack of strong opposition and elites’ complacency, cynicism, docility and failure to provide leadership to their communities. He argued that the decay cannot be blamed on the present administration alone, though lack of vision, focus, sincerity of purpose, reckless spending of public funds and wanton disregard for due process have further aggravated the rot in the administration of governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu. He said: “In area where the state has comparative advantage like agriculture and had received over N17bn from the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN), it has not fared better. If 40 per cent of this amount were channeled to genuine farmers with good management, huge positive impact would have been made. Yet, a false picture of agricultural transformation is being made,” he observed.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
