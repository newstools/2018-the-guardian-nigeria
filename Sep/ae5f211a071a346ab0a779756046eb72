Gov. Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara, the Chairman of NGF Zamfara state governor Abdulaziz Abubakar Yari Monday declared his intention to contest for a seat at the Nigerian Senate in next year’s general elections. The governor will seek to unseat Ahmad Sani Yarima, also a former governor of Zamfara, who is serving his third term as Senator representing Zamfara West he seeks to represent. Yari, who expressed his intent to newsmen in Gusau, said he was contesting for the seat for the interest he has in legislative process and service to his people. “You know, I was from the National Assembly before I become a governor, in fact, my colleagues from the National Assembly use to say I am here on sabbatical,” Yari said. “So, my going to the Senate is like I am going back home, some people are asking me why I want to go to the Senate? “In fact, even some people in the Presidency are asking me why I want to go to the Senate, I told them is just an interest. In 200, Yari was elected a member of House of Representatives where he represented Anka/Talata Mafara Federal Constituency from 2007 to 2011. “I learned a lot from the National Assembly and what I learned there has really assisted me in my administration as governor in the last eight years, especially in the areas of budget process and resources management,” Yari said.
