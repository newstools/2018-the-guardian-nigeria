The Super Eagles had originally been scheduled to play Saudi Arabia in a friendly but the fixture was cancelled because of concerns about logistics. The Super Eagles were eliminated in the group stage at the World Cup in Russia. The Nigerian federation is emerging from a turbulent period. Nigeria last month escaped suspension by FIFA over a long-running court case focusing on the disputed leadership of one of Africa’s football powerhouses. Tuesday’s match in Liberia will follow the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Seychelles in Victoria on Saturday. The team then go into a qualification double-header against Libya in October. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
