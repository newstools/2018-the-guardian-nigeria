Hollywood has been awash with sexual misconduct scandals recently and following that, stars that have been accused of misconduct have faced backlash, snubbery and even lawsuits. Recently Kevin Spacey who stars in the hit drama House of Cards has been removed from the show. His character was eliminated by death.  Kevin Spacey  Some stars since the wave, have condemned the behaviour but Dame Judi Dench has criticised the treatment given to Kevin Spacey she has said that it was wrong to remove her “good friend” Kevin Spacey’s performance in a recent film. “I can’t approve, in any way, of the fact – whatever he has done – that you then start to cut him out of films,” she said at a film festival in Spain. She described Spacey as “an inestimable comfort” when they worked on a film after her husband’s death. The Oscar-winning actor has been accused of sexual misconduct which he denies. The scandal caused Director Ridley Scott to withdraw him from performing a role in All The Money In The World and opt for Christopher Plummer in his stead. Dame Judi Dench speaking at the San Sebastian Film Festival: “Are we to go back throughout history now and anyone who has misbehaved in any way, or has broken the law, or has committed some kind of offence, are they always going to be cut out?” she told reporters. “Are we going to exclude them from our history? I don’t know about any of the conditions of it, but nevertheless I think he is, and was, a most wonderful actor… and a good friend.” Her opinion, however, has garnered mixed reactions on social media. While some are praising her for ‘speaking her mind’ and are of the opinion that people should be given ‘second chances’ others are ‘sickened’ by her support. According to a spokeswoman for the actor, Spacey is “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.”
