 FHAâ€™s Managing Director, Prof. Mohammed Al-Amin  The subsidary to be called Federal Housing Facility Management Agency (FHFMA) will be responsible for infrastructural development in federal housing estates across the country. FHA Managing, Professor Mohammed Al-Amin who made this known at the inspection of federal housing estate phase I, Lugbe in Abuja, said FHFMA when established will assist to boost infrastructural development in federal housing estates as well as the maintenance. He believes that with good maintenance culture it will save government more funds to construct new houses than reworking on the old ones. According to him, the tour embarked upon by the agency was the continuation of assessment of facilities the agency had commenced, and how to work out ways to provide finance. Al-Amin asserted that there was the need to maintain the infrastructure provided by the government and pave way for all inclusive housing agenda. He regretted that residents of housing estates have poor maintenance culture, which was causing government huge amount of money for provision of infrastructure instead of building new houses for Nigerians. The MD also identified building of houses on waterways as an issue that the agency will not overlook, especially the ones without approval from the housing authority. He said despite the commitment of the present administration to housing development there would not be success if appropriate measures are not put in place. Also, the Chairman, FHA Lugbe, Abuja Municipal Council, Mr. Odelana Adesina listed challenges facing the residents as congestion, bad roads and insecurity.
