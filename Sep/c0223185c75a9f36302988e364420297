Kaduna State Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai has reiterated his administration’s support for the creative industry. He also said his government is committed to creating a veritable platform for art and culture development in the country.
   
El-Rufai said this yesterday at the opening of the 2018 Kaduna Book and Arts Festival (Kabafest) holding in Kaduna.  In another development, a Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja yesterday ordered the remand of Chief Executive Officer of Canbit Music, Olusegun Are, in prison for allegedly defrauding an American firm, Renovate America Incorporated. Justice Oyindamola Ogala, who ordered the defendant to be remanded in prison following his arraignment by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a 21-count charge bordering on fraud, adjourned the case. The anti-graft alleged that the defendant defrauded the company through a new type of phishing called Ijobak, which lures human resources, accounting and payroll members of staff of a company to disclose vital details of all the employees in the company. Are pleaded not guilty to all the count charges read to him. But the EFCC counsel, Babatunde Sonoiki, prayed the court to remand the defendant in prison  pending the defendant’s discussion with the commission on likely plea-bargaining.
