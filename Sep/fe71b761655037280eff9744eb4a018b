Since its introduction in 2014, Mercedes-Benz Vito has continued to position itself as a pacesetter in the mid-size van segment and in the transport industry in Nigeria. The mid-size van, born from Mercedes-Benz’s boldest genes, has become an active part of the ‘Mercedes-Benz vans goes global’ business unit strategy, which was in response to the need of worldwide customers for maximum availability of Mercedes-Benz products in every market. Weststar Associates Limited, authorised general distributor of Mercedes-Benz in Nigeria made available the mid-size Van, which boasts of top value for total cost of ownership (TCO) as well as outstanding economy, and technology, with emphasis to its safety and assistance systems. With the Vito Tourer, Mercedes-Benz has opened a new chapter in passenger transport. It is divided into the highly functional and robust Vito Tourer BASE, the versatile Vito Tourer PRO and the high-quality Vito Tourer SELECT. Meaning, the Vito Tourer can be tailored to accommodate all types of passenger transport, as its functional design and reliable quality makes it the perfect workhorse for every working day. The Vito Tourer has space for up to nine seats (depending on the model), an optional panoramic sliding sunroof and sliding doors that enable comfortable access to the vehicle. The length variants in the Vito Tourer provide a very spacious interior that delivers comfort for both driver and passengers. With three lengths spanning the Compact (4.90 m), Long (5.14 m) and Extra-Long (5.37 m) variants, the Vito offers plenty of choice. In the Vito Tourer the passenger compartment and installed seating have options of two and three-passenger bench seats. The seats can be installed on wood or plastic flooring, or on a floor with fine carpeting for use as an exclusive shuttle. There is also the option of an 8 seater as standard in the Vito Tourer PRO and a nine-seater as standard in the Vito Tourer BASE.
Both the driver and passengers are comfortably seated in the interior of the Vito Tourer, benefiting from more space than in previous models. Now completely redesigned, the Vito’s cockpit is exemplary in terms of its functionality and ergonomics, while the seats remain comfortable even during long journeys, thanks to their robust upholstery fabric an ergonomic cushioning. The optional audio systems make the journey even more enjoyable with excellent connections and entertainment while on the move. The audio systems available include the Audio10, Audio 15 radios and the Becker MAP PILOT navigation system. The Vito Tourer impresses with the rear-wheel drive and four-cylinder petrol engine variants, equipped with a 2.15-litre displacement and up to 155 KW (211 HP) power output. Another highlight is the optional 7-speed automatic transmission 7G-TRONIC PLUS which comes with excellent ride comfort and low fuel consumption figures, while the standard 6-speed manual transmission also offers an impressively good balance between agility and efficiency. Like every other Mercedes-Benz product, the Vito Tourer places strong emphasis on safety first with numerous assistance systems. The Vito Tourer PRO and Vito Tourer SELECT models are equipped as standard with windowbags and thorax/pelvis side bags in the front while the windowbags in the rear are optionally available for the Vito Tourer. With up to eight airbags in total, it is the benchmark in its class.
ATTENTION ASSIST, Hill-Start Assist and Crosswind Assist are part of the standard equipment. Crosswind Assist virtually eliminates the effects of wind gusts acting on the vehicle, while the Hill-Start Assist helps you when pulling away forwards or in reverse on an uphill gradient. The tyre pressure monitoring is another item of standard equipment in the Vito Tourer. In addition, the Vito may be equipped with numerous other assistance systems to suit individual needs. Examples include the only Active Parking Assist system for vans, COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST and Blind Spot Assist.

The ILS consists of LED turn signal indicators and LED daytime running lights, as well as of LED low-beam, high-beam, and cornering lights. These headlights can adjust the manner in which they distribute their beams in line with the speed of the vehicle and requirements on the road or highway.
