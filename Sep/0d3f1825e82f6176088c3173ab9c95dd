 Secretary General of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Mohammed Sanusi  The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had earlier written to African football governing body, CAF to bring the game forward to Saturday, October 13 instead of October 12 due to logistics considerations. But now, it appears the NFF will shift the game to Uyo, which hosted Super Eagles Russia 2018 World Cup qualifiers last year.NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi declined comments on the venue change yesterday, but The Guardian learnt that the federation had informed CAF of its intention to take the game to Uyo. Sources at the NFF revealed that facilities at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna failed to meet basic requirements for hosting a game of such magnitude.
“The Ahmadu Bello Stadium is in need of repairs and the state of the pitch, which was near perfect when Gernot Rohr visited last month, has deteriorated to a level not fit enough for a game of such magnitude. “So, the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State has been forwarded to both CAF and Libyan FA as the new venue of the match on October 12.”“Akwa Ibom State has successfully repaired the pitch, which was damaged during one of the political events of the Akwa Ibom State Governor,” one of the sources said.
