Ghanaian producer and reggae-dancehall star Charles Nii Armah Mensah Jr, popularly known as Shatta Wale, is set to drop his anticipated album Reign. To that effect, the Dancehall King singer has released a powerful cover art and also the tracklist of the forthcoming album. Posing right in the middle of the cover art, he passes a strong message of his heritage. Shatta Wale also unveiled a video clip of his journey over the years. The trendy video shows him addressing the recent controversies surrounding his image, including the October deadline given to him by a Ghanaian prophet who claimed to have foreseen his death shortly after the demise of dancehall queen Ebony. Check out the album art, tracklist and video below: <img class="size-full wp-image-742060 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/8E5E7758-1D2D-4FB1-8048-FBB1FEF7A8E1.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="989" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-742064 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="983" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764.jpeg 1000w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764-608x598.jpeg 608w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764-487x479.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764-974x957.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764-244x240.jpeg 244w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764-488x480.jpeg 488w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A909AEA5-6E38-42AA-8161-B4828F7FD764-600x590.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />   Never ever despise small Beginnings #TheReignAlbum Art Direction :@_kwamekyei_ Photography: @awesomecurtis Script: @kwesiiasomadu Video Production: @inkyinkyim A post shared by  SHATTA WALE  (@shattawalenima) on Sep 16, 2018 at 1:47am PDT
