Despite reports that national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, and Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State are on a war path, a source close to the governor said he still has a chummy relationship with his political godfather. The source also denied that the governor was planning to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).“There is no rift and there can never be a rift,” the aide told The Guardian. “It is not possible for the governor, the poster boy of the party, to join the PDP.” Several online platforms recently reported that Ambode and Tinubu fell out because of their varying positions on the nature of the primary election to be used to select APC governorship candidate in the state. APC National Executive Committee (NEC) on September 1 said all primary elections for elective offices would be through direct primaries except where impediments would make it impossible. “The use of indirect primaries is conditional and dependent on logistic impediments, peculiarities and the needs that make a given state unable to use direct primaries,” APC acting national publicity secretary, Yekini Nabena, stated. However, the source noted that there was no way difference in opinion on direct primaries could have caused a rift between Tinubu and Ambode, since the governor is the only person in APC that had indicated interest in Lagos governorship in 2019. “As I speak, there is no contender for APC governorship primary with Ambode.“Nobody is coming out; even in PDP, nobody is coming out. The governor is the only person that is contesting. To the best of my knowledge, I don’t think anybody from the party is coming to challenge him. That will be difficult,” the source noted.The governor’s aide noted that “APC has become stronger in the state in the last one week” following the defection of PDP state chairman, Moshood Salvador, to the party.
