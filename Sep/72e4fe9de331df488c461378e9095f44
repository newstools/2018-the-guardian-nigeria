Chloe and Halle Bailey were discovered while they were young teenagers, they performed Beyonce’s Pretty Hurts on YouTube five years ago. This performance captured the attention of Beyonce herself who shared on her Facebook page with the caption: “So amazingly talented!!” The sisters were soon signed by Beyonce to her label Parkwood Entertainment label after learning they were unsigned. They have moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles, they have released an award-nominated debut album, featured in TV show which they wrote the theme song-Grown-ish. They are opening for Beyonce and Jay-Z on their On The Road II stadium tour.  A few years later, they have uprooted from Atlanta to Los Angeles, released an award-nominated debut album, landed roles in TV show Grown-ish (for which they wrote the theme song), and are currently opening for Beyonce and Jay-Z on their On The Road II stadium tour. They wrote and produced their debut album themselves, according to Halle the younger of the duo,” Pretty much the whole album we did in our living room. This duo uses their living room to write and produce their songs on their own. They have learnt to be self-reliant, confident, independent and resourceful through their parents. They have shown a maturity in handling their talent which is quite remarkable for their age. Chloe and Halle are obviously happy doing what they love which expressing themselves through music. They are each others sounding board and compliment each other.
