 a source said at the weekend that Alkali may have been killed together with the 11 people who were murdered on September 2, 2018 by unknown gunmen after which the youths protested and barricaded the road at Lopandet Dwei Community in Du District of Jos South Local Council of Plateau State.  This was revealed after Commander of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), Major General Augustine Agundu, visited the pond where the general’s body and car may have been dumped. Spokesman of the Special Task Force (STF), Major Adam Umar, told The Guardian that the team had started draining the water where his body might have been dumped. “On Sunday, September 2, 2018 youth in the area protested the killing of their kinsmen and possibly the missing general could have been among the victims and we suspect that his body could be in the water. “Although we are not sure where his body could have been dumped, we strongly suspect that he could be one of those thrown inside the pond. But as I speak, the draining of the water is still ongoing,” he said.
