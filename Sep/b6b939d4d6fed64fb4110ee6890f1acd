Lagos State government, yesterday, appealed to stakeholders in the contentious issue of wearing Hijab in public schools to maintain peace, law and order while the Supreme Court ruling on the matter is being awaited. Speaking on the refusal of entry of five students of Isolo Senior Secondary School on September 18, 2018, Deputy Governor, Lagos State, Dr. Idiat Oluranti Adebule said the government was working assiduously to resolve the matter.
 
She said in the interim, the principal of the school has been redeployed to douse tension and allow for thorough investigation into the matter.Adebule urged the public to be patient with government in dealing with the matter, as according to her, “it is important for the general public to know that there is Public Service Rule, which must be adhered to strictly in dealing with public servants in the event that they are found culpable of any charges.” The Deputy Governor acknowledged letters addressed to her by Hijab Rights Advocacy Initiative, Muslim Students Society of Nigeria and Muslim Forum of Isolo over the issue and assured that their grievances were being looked into.
