After the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee at the national headquarters in Abuja on Friday, the People’s Democratic Party has insisted on Port Harcout, Rivers State, as the venue for its National Convention. The convention which will produce PDP’s presidential candidate for the 2019 elections is scheduled for October 5-6, 2018. The party had earlier announced Port Harcout as the venue for the convention but the choice of the venue was protested by some members of the party with claims that the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, is supporting one of the presidential aspirants. After the 82nd NEC meeting, the Party spokesman, Kola Ologbodiyan confirmed that the committee came to a unanimous decision that the convention will hold in Port Harcout. He assured the Presidential aspirants of a transparent process at the national convention.

Ologbodiyan noted that the aspirants have collectively assured the party that their fears over the Port Harcout convention has been allayed by the party. The PDP spokesman said the NEC has resolved that they will be committing all the presidential aspirants to a bond on the outcome of the convention. HE explained that all the aspirants will sign an agreement with the party in order to ensure that the outcome of the national convention will be accepted by them.
