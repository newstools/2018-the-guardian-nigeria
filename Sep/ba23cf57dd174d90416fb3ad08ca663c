 Nyesom Ezenwo Wike  Rivers State governor, Nyesome Wike, got a reprieve and survived mounting criticisms from party leaders on Friday, thanks to the intervention of some of his colleagues interested in attracting the PDP Vice Presidential candidate to their states. The politics of who becomes PDP Vice Presidential candidate, it was learnt, was partly the reason some states withdrew interests from hosting the party’s national convention. It was gathered that governors of states, where alternative venues were earlier suggested, declined the offer for hidden political agenda. Aside Rivers, other states earlier suggested included Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Abia. Governors of these states were believed to have reached a compromise to withdraw interests from hosting the convention, a development that left the venue for only Rivers State at the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting. Further findings revealed Rivers State has agreed to support one of the states that withdrew interest in hosting the convention to produce a Vice Presidential candidate. For making statements, which many perceived as threat to the entire party, Wike’s popularity suffered considerable damage in the last few days, leading to the NEC emergency meeting. The Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee was sharply divided over whether or not to adopt Port Harcourt as venue for the convention.
