 Skye Bank  This was declared by the apex bank Governor Godwin Emefile on Friday evening in Lagos. Meanwhile, Polaris Bank has been established to assume ownership of the assets and liabilities of Skye Bank, while the management of the defunct bank was retained for its good performance. Emefile said N786 billion has been injected into the bank with the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria ordered to commence the sale process of the bank from Monday.
