The Lagos based Nigerian photographer, Stephen Tayo and his eye-catching pictures recently got themselves featured on the Vogue runway. And in case you are wondering, this is why… He is young, promising and very creative This 24-year-old stylist and photographer whose works have gained appearance in It’s Nice That, INDIE magazine and Coeval Magazine and has also worked with Poppy Lissiman and ALARA Lagos, has had his style influenced through time by his family were they all wore similar outfits to show love and unity. And he has so far, managed to use photography to tell realities and capture the peaceful and rustic side of cities.

Photo credit: Stephen Tayo He understands that there is a need for connection and that possibilities are endless This graduate of philosophy understands Aristotle when he says, ‘… a single soul dwelling in two bodies’, as he always tries to get into the mind of his subjects and capture them in their own element. With no formal training in photography and his favourite word being possibility, there is nothing he hasn’t accomplished yet. Photo credit: Stephen Tayo He steals the show! From the pictures, there is really no doubt that Tayo leaves his mark everywhere he goes and he did just that in Accra with the Chale Wote festival Photo credit: Stephen Tayo And because vogue says so… Vogue runaway writes, “Our vision is to cultivate a wider audience for the arts in West Africa by breaking creative boundaries and using art as a viable form to rejuvenate public spaces.” And that is what Stephen Tayo is successfully doing!
