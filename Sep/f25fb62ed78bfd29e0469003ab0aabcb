 Mild drama played out, yesterday, in Takum Local Council of Taraba State, as some youths attacked the convoy of Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Senator Alhassan Jumai Aisha.  Elated by the development, the Taraba State chapter of the party said the decision of the screening committee was in the overall interest of the party in the state, because Alhassan has caused more crisis in the party than peace. Speaking with The Guardian, the party’s Public Relations Officer (PRO) Aaron Artimas, said even though the national secretariat has not given reason for her not being screened, she has consistently caused problem in the party. Disclosing how the minister has been creating disaffections among party members in the state, especially after the state congress that led to the emergence of parallel executive, Artimas said the recent decision of the party’s national leadership has laid to rest the wrangling in the party. “The party that was earlier segmented into various factions will now come together as one. I must confess to you that the decision of our national body has brought great relief to us and the party at large.” The Guardian investigation reveals that Alhassan and her teeming supporters have commenced moves to defect to another party.
