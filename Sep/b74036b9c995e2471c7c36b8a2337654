The National Bureau of  Statistics (NBS) said Nigeria recorded a trade surplus of N2.36trillion in the second quarter of 2018. According to a report posted on its website on Thursday, Total value of trade for the second quarter of 2018 was recorded at N6.57trillion which indicates a -8.89 percent contraction from N7.21Trillion and marks the first fall in trade value since the second quarter of 2016.
