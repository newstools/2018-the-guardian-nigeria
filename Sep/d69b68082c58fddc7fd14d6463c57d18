It grows in areas of low rainfall ranging from 100-800mm, with dry season that can last more than six months. Plants can grow in areas where there is no distinct dry season either. Habitat Sand dunes along the coast. Coastal: grasslands, rocky slopes and shrub lands from 200level to elevation of 3,500 meters. The plant is occasionally harvested from the wild for local use as food. The edible part being the root/tuber, which is cooked to supply palatable nutritious starch given to children and invalids.

Soil and Site Alstroemerias require, moisture retentive, well-drained soil and a warm situation in sun or semi-shade. Prefers a dry sheltered border and a peaty loam. Established plants are drought tolerant according to one report, whilst another says soil should not be allowed to dry out in the growing season. Plants succeed in maritime gardens. It is not hardy in cold regions. All Alstroemerias like good living, so give them plenty of organic matter at their roots. Soil: Suitable for light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers well-drained soil. pH: Acid neutral, and basic (alkaline) soils.
Light: You can grow in semi-shade or no shade. However, Alstroemeria grows best in locations with full morning sun and some shade in the afternoons. If you’re growing Alstroemeria indoors, pick a sunny window ledge or a spot with lightly filtered sunshine. Propagation You grow Alstroemerias from seed or division of rhizomes. Containers It’s well worth growing Alstroemerias in containers too. Fill your containers with good quality well-drained soil. Almost any commercially available potting medium will work fine. Alternatively, you could use a mix of 1:1 perlite and vermiculite or 1:1 organic and inorganic material if you plan to grow Alstroemerias in a container. Pot them up into generous 5litre pots. Make sure there are adequate drainage holes: Alstroemeria plants must not sit in water logged soil or they will rot. Aftercare Water Alstroemeria when dry. Once your Alstroemeria is established, it won’t need much water. Lightly water when the top 1 inch(2.5cm) of soil is dry. Too much water will lead to root rot. Mulch Alstroemeria to protect it. Place protective mulch around your Alstroemeria can protect it from extreme temperatures. You can mulch with staw. Pick, rather than cut, the flowers. Whether you want to bring some inside to put in a vase, or you need to remove spent blooms, you’ll need to pick out each stem. Pull one or more entire stalks out of the soil or potting medium. Don’t cut the flowers, as the underground meristems will respond to the damage and die. Each flower has its own stalk, so won’t harm the entire plant by pulling a few stalks. In order to encourage growth regularly deadhead spent blooms. Cut Flower: Arrange with a drop of bleach in their flower water, and with new water every 4-5 days, they’ll last 3weeks in a vase.
