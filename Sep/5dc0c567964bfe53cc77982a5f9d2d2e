 [FILE PHOTO] INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmoud Yakubu  At a workshop it organised in Abuja yesterday, the commission sought to identify and reflect on practical, effective and implementable ways females could participate in the nation’s politics. Recognising that the electorate consists of diverse people with special abilities, the commission is keen in ensuring that inclusivity and participation are integral parts of its policies. INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmud Yakubu, said at the event themed ‘INEC’s Role in ensuring Women Participation in the Electoral Process’, that the commission was committed to continually improving on the electoral process. Such a position, he noted, was also indicative of INEC’s commitment to the consolidation of democracy in Nigeria. According to him, bringing together female politicians, academics and civil society activists across all social and political divides indicates that the workshop is a further affirmation of INEC’s unflinching commitment towards deepening participation and expanding inclusivity in its electoral process.
