Aliyu Haidar Abubakar The son of the first female president of Nigeria’s Court of Appeal Zainab Bulkachuwa has joined the race to succeed Hassan Dankwambo as the governor of Gombe State. Aliyu Haidar Abubakar is contesting on the platform of the All Progressives Congress and has submitted his nomination and expression of interest forms at the party’s national headquarters in Abuja. “The tragic and appalling level of governance in Gombe State demands a youthful leadership greatly imbued with charisma, foresight and vision,” youthful Abubakar said. “My aspiration and fervent dream to pilot the affairs of the state and take it to the promised land are altruistic and noble. “This is the time to change the Gombe narrative for good. It’s time the state takes its rightful position in the comity of states across the federation. “It is sad that we are still at a crossroads, while sister states have become model for accelerated growth and progress in all facets of human endeavours. “A new dawn awaits Gombe if I am elected next year. I will definitely raise the bar of exemplary, accountable and service leadership.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
