The UN peacekeeper was injured in an attack in the northern town of Menaka, officials said, without giving his nationality. Keita won 67 percent of the vote against runner-up Soumailla Cisse, a former finance minister, who scored nearly 33 percent in a hard-fought runoff on August 12. His re-election came despite fierce criticism of failures to tackle jihadist violence and ethnic tensions that have rocked the poor Sahel state. Keita’s major challenge as he starts his second term will be to strengthen a 2015 peace accord between the government, government-allied groups and former Tuareg rebels that the government sees as a cornerstone of peace.
