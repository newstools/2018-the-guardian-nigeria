PHOTO:Nigeria vs Greece. FIBA It was a tense, pulsating, yet thrilling end to the match at Santa Cruz de Tenerife.  D’Tigress clinched a quarter final berth with the slimmest of margins in the quarterfinal qualifying fixture against Greece. Despite Greece leading into the final 20 seconds of the game, Nigeria battled to the dramatic finish. Three seconds to the end of the game, Elo Edema Edeferioka won an offensive rebound and drew a foul from Maria Fasoula. She comfortably scored the free-throws that followed and Nigeria got into the lead which they held on as the ‘long’ three seconds counted down. Greece had possession in the final three seconds but frittered it away with a five seconds violation. In the final action of the game, Ezinne Kalu drew a foul with two seconds left of the game but she missed both free-throws and failed to extend the lead. It mattered very little as the buzzer blasted to signal the historic feat by the ladies. They became the first African team to reach the quarterfinal of the FIBA Women’s World Cup.
