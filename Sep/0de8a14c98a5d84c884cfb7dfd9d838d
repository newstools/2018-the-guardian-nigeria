The general manager also said that the structures marked for demolition were not only built on water canals, but lack government approval. Gbilekaa said that areas that would be affected “are Nyiman extension, Achussa, Genabe, Owner Occupier, Wadata and High-level, Naka Road and some communities in North Bank.’’ He, however, explained that marking a house does not necessarily lead to demolition as houses were marked sometimes because they have no records with the board. Gbilekaa warned the residents of the state against raising illegal structures that such buildings stand the risk of being demolished. He also advised them to ensure that due process was followed when obtaining approval for their structures.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
