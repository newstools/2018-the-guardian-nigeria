The world has come a long way to ensure the promotion of education and reduce illiteracy.  According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics [UIS] records that 50 years ago there was almost 25% of youth who lacked basic literacy skills in the world, as compared to 10% in 2016. There has been an improvement in literacy rate in the world. The adult literacy rate was 86% in 2016
Youth literacy rate was 91% in 2016 According to UNESCO Institute for Statistics [UIS], the adult literacy rate in Sub-saharan Africa is 65%%.
With the male literacy rate at 72%  and female literacy rate at 57%.
While the youth literacy rate is 75%.
With the male at 79% and the female literacy rate at 72%. Although Africa records the lowest in literacy rate, remarkably some countries in Africa have grown tremendously to achieve as much as a 95% percentile. They have adopted the education policy laid down by UNESCO by ensuring they tackle illiteracy through compulsory education for primary education and setting up adult education centres. The theme for the 2018 International Literacy day is ‘Literacy and Skills Development’. This theme is geared towards equipping individuals in not just basic reading and writing but encouraging learning skills sets to be used in sustainable economic development. Literacy requirements have evolved from just reading and writing to possessing skills necessary to tackle the work environment in the real world. Demands exist in the workplace that skills sets are required to tackle them. There have been so many initiatives to promote and encourage skill development which will reduce poverty and contribute to the development of Africa. The African Development Bank has set up initiatives to train young adults in various skills.
