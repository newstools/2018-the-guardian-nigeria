Football in the west African nation is in the midst of a crisis, with its league suspended because of funding issues. CAF had been expected to make a final decision at their meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh on Friday. But CAF said there had been a “big delay in the building of infrastructure”. “The final decision will be made at the end of November,” it said in a statement. An inspection committee of officials from CAF and world football’s governing body FIFA will visit Cameroon in October “to examine security issues”, it added. CAF did however confirm the dates of the tournament as June 15-July 13. The tournament used to take place in January, forcing European clubs to release their players in the middle of the season. Morocco, which unsuccessfully bid to host the 2026 World Cup, has lobbied to replace Cameroon as hosts.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
