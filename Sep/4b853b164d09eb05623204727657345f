 Handball  According to the sponsor, winners of the competitions are expected to go home with the prize money of N1million. Runners up will get N750,000, while the third placed teams will settle for N500,000 in both categories of the 12 days contests. Other prizes include awards for the most valuable players on each day of the championship. Fans are also not left out of the fiesta, as they too will smile home with electronic appliances and other consolatory prizes via lottery draws. Speaking at the occasion to herald the league, the Managing Director of Prudent Energy Service Limited, Abdulwasiu Olatunde Sowami, said the firm took the decision to sponsor the moribund sport due to the neglect it has suffered over some years in the hands of the government. “We are particularly interested in handball as a sport because we have come to realise that the sport in Nigeria is not well supported by the government and private sector. “We are happy to partner with the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN) and we will actively support, promote and help develop the league because we share common passion with the current HFN board. “Our involvement represents a step further in cementing our commitment to corporate social responsibility, whilst boosting our brand profile,” he said. While commending Prudent Energy for its support, the HFN president, Sam Ocheho, said the bond is for five years. “It has been a long time people talk about the game of handball in the country. Our partners are here to revive the sport and restore us back to that pedestal. “Our sponsor also promised us that they will give N500,000 to every participating team as a token for the championship. On our part, we want to keep organising competitions in order to keep pace with other sports in the country,” he stated.
