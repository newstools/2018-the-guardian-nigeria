The battle for honours in the on-going FIBA Women World Cup was expected to be difficult for Nigeria’s women national team, D’Tigress. The girls, even as African champions, are rated among the least likely teams to win the trophy in Tenerife, Spain. But their fans expect them to get to at least the second round of the competition. That is not too much to ask for, except that they are faced with first round matches against some of the best teams in the world. It is a difficult proposition, but the girls say they are equal to the task. D’Tigress begins their campaign in the competition today against world superpower, Australia by 12.30 a.m. Nigerian time. And so, after weeks of intensive preparations, which started in Atlanta and ended in Turkey, the African champions ranked 34th in the world will meet the fourth-ranked Australia at the San Cristobal de La Laguna, Santiago Martin Arena in Tenerife.
It is tipped as a Herculean task for the D’Tigress, but the girls are not known to shy away fro challenges. Head coach, Otis Hughley sees today’s game as a big test that would bring the best out of his girls. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
