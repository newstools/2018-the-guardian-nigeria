 [File] Cycling  The ‘Ride to school’ program seeks to empower students with free bicycles, acquired through support from its donors. During the presentation ceremony at the school, the ACF President, Yemi Osilaja, restated his foundation’s commitment to assist indigent students in rural areas realise their academic potentials. “Millions of students in rural Africa are deprived of vital access to education or perform below their potential, simply because of the distances they have to walk to and from school every day. ACF seeks to change this by providing them with study bicycles”, he added. Osilaja disclosed that the foundation’s goal of donating over 200 bicycles this year under its programme for indigent students in Lagos, Ogun and Abuja was informed by the need to promote learning among the less privileged. While lauding the organisation for the initiative, the school principal, Mrs Omolola Hassan, said the donation would transform the lives and performances of students. “This is the second time the foundation is blessing our school with these bicycles, after donating a bike to one of our girls last year. The student, Olayinka Adebowale, has improved in her academic performance. We hope for more bikes for our students.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
