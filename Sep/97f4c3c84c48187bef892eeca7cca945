In line with its mandate to sustain a dynamic and comprehensive health service delivery system, Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Ebute-Metta, Lagos has outlined ways to fund developmental projects for quality, efficient and affordable services delivery. When The Guardian visited the facility, massive structural and infrastructural developments were seen ranging from renovation of wards, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), neo natal care unit, world-class equipment among others.Medical Director, FMC Ebute-Metta, Dr. Ademola Dada, said that the centre has in a systematic way begun to resolve the issue of infrastructure ravaging the facility over the years. “If you go round you will notice some renovations. We are still going to do more and after four years when we step aside and someone else continues maybe in few years to come, we will have a highly functional and efficient and clean hospital where services and responsible attitude to patients exist,” he said. Prior his appointment, Dada noted that he was driven by the fact that Nigeria can also build world-class institutions and the opportunity has come for him demonstrate it to the world.  “It is not going to happen in one day but ultimately at some point we are going to solve the problems revolving around healthcare in Nigeria,” he added. The MD continued: “Due to the good works we do, we are getting letters from organisations who want to use our hospital and have a relationship with us. This is because of quality of service we offer. If you actually take into consideration the work we have done, we are also keen for people to point out the area we need to improvement and we believe we can improve.” On accountability and corruption, Dada explained that his administration has made huge effort to curtail the scourge ravaging the sector. He noted that immediately he took over, remittal mode of payment was introduced thereby creating a lot of confidence because staffs are not allowed to handle cash anymore. “We are appointed to serve and let people have value for service. If we are appointed to serve then we must be accountable to the people,” he added. Reacting to the poor maintenance culture across the country, Dada continued: “Though people always talk about maintenance, apart from our maintenance structure we have a maintenance gang what they do is to respond to faults 24hour. A lot of people have expressed fears on maintenance, my challenge has always been to those people to come back between two or three years to come and have a look. “I can assure you that none of the facility put on ground will depreciate because it is very clear in our mind when we are choosing people who will do the work. We also have written agreement with those people. If you supply to us what is of substandard quality, we are going to call you back. This is because the whole system is transparent and in line with procurement act.  It actually assisted us in getting the best, it is not done the typical Nigeria way of inviting your friends and because they are neutral people, we are also neutral. We provided solid supervision and then we are convinced that facility wont deteriorate we do not have any doubt for what so ever.”On the challenges of running the facility, the Medical Director lamented on paucity of space and scarce of resources as they are thinking outside the box to continue with it giant stride developments. “We still have some areas where we have not touched; we are having some challenges in the theatre. The information at hand is that we have to close down the theatre for three months if we would want to do a thorough work and if you close down the theatre in a tertiary institution for three months, it is a whole lot of challenge.  We are looking at alternatives, where to locate the theatre temporarily to complete the work. It is a process. “When I first came in, I can say to you clearly, we virtually had no ICU. It was there but there were no equipment. The facility did not arouse much confidence in the consultants. Most of the consultants do not admit their patients there, but in the last eight months after we have renovated the ICU, if you ask now, you find out that we have seen huge number of patients. We have a peculiar ICU policy here, whether you have money or you do not have money, if your situation is critical enough to warrant ICU care, we take you there without you paying a dime. “Many patients have been taken care of in the ICU discharged some paid and some have not. To us, in decisions between the critical stages of life when the patient needs ICU is not a financial decision, it is a moral decision, and it is a decision taken with a lot of responsibilities.” He continued: “In dialysis, we equally have the cheapest dialysis centre, when I came in, it was one machine that is working but now we have up to four machines working. To me, if we keep hitting at the problem with sincerity and honesty of propose we will get there.” “For instance, if you look at the neonatal intensive care, when we came, virtually all the incubators are not working.  People are afraid, the paediatricians were afraid to put babies there and incubators are expensive. What did I do? I called in the General Electric, they were able to supply us incubators, and we paid in installments.  They brought the latest equipment. They are the ones pursing me now that I should take more equipment. Likewise the ventilator that is how we got it too and we have the same arrangement with Emzor, they supply equipment and we pay every month. This is developing a means to solve a peculiar financial problem.” Dada attributed the recorded success of the facility to its strategic location in Lagos. He said: “We are able to interact with a wider range of organisation. We are able to leverage on the advantage of our location we also able to manage the resources and think outside the box for us to be able to function. I am not appointed to fold my hands and say that there is money and there is nothing I can do. I am appointed to think outside the box and we are hopefully in the near future we would have moved our administration substantially. We do not even need to invite people to take a look. The work will speak for itself and we must be focused we must not allow ourselves to be distracted and it is not about publicity, it is about delivering services so that our patients actual be the one to deliver the message.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
