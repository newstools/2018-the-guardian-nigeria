 LASU  The members who protested at the governorâ€™s office at Alausa in their hundreds, carried placards with various inscriptions. The Lagos zone coordinator of ASUU, Sowande Olusiji gave the names of the affected members as Tony Dansu, Adeolu Oyekan and Oluwafemi Aboderin-Shonibare, who are secretary, assistant secretary and treasurer respectively, saying the management was planning to sack them for allegedly exposing a document that unduly backdated the promotion of the incumbent vice-chancellor, Olarenwaju Fagbohun, from associate to professor. Olusiji, who in solidarity with the so-called victimised members, said the Vice-Chancellor went ahead to invite the trio to join Senate Council Disciplinary Committee, noting his conviction that the intervention of the Governor, whom he described as visitor, would go a long way in resolving the matter. Responding, Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Labour, Babatunde Oladeinde, said the Governor is aware of the matter and would hold a meeting regarding the issue today.
