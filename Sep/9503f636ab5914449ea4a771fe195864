But the first step to change that dynamic is not to find an excuse on the racquet or on the string or on something that is not the truth. The only truth is that you have to do things better to be able to fight for the point and fight for the match.” That’s just what the 17-time Grand Slam champion did over the course of a 4-hour 49-minute epic that concluded at 2:04 a.m. on Wednesday. When it was all over, Nadal was happy to be in a seventh US Open semi-final, but even happier that he’d done everything he could to turn the match around. “I played a lot of long and tough matches in my career. That’s one more today,” he said after his 0-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/5) win. “In some way when you give everything that you have, win or lose the personal satisfaction when you give everything and you play with the right attitude is the same.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
