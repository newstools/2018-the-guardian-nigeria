APC leader, Adams Oshiomole Nigeria’s ruling party, All Progressives Congress, has postponed the governorship primaries for Lagos and Imo states. The party has rescheduled its primary initially fixed for Sunday in the two states to Monday. The National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomole, said during the inauguration of the governorship primary committees in Abuja that the primary in both states was shifted due to logistics reasons. He noted that the primaries in other state will proceed on Sunday as earlier scheduled. Although APC has claimed the reason for the reschedule is due to logistics reasons, there are speculations that the postponement of the Lagos gubernatorial primary  is because of the ongoing rift rocking the APC Lagos chapter. The Guardian reported that the story of who becomes the governorship flag-bearer for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos, took a new turn on Saturday as one of the aspirants Obafemi Hamzat stepped down and endorsed fellow aspirant Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Hamzat renounced his decision to contest in the APC governorship primary election at a press briefing attended by Sanwo-Olu and other party members in Lagos. This could pose a huge challenge for the incumbent governor Akinwunmi Ambode as the two aspirants have joined forces to defeat him in the APC primary.
