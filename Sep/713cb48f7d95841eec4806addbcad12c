The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigerian, Alhaji Aminu Goronyo, has said that 12.2 millions of members across the country jointly contributed money for the purchase of nomination form for President Muhammadu Buhari’s second terms. Goronyo, who led other national and state officials of the association on a visit to Kebbi State Governor Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, in his capacity as the Chairman of Presidential Task Force on Rice and Wheat Production in Nigeria, expressed happiness and commended the President and the governor for encouraging rice production in the country, which he said significantly reduced rice importation, adding that all Nigerian have started seeing the benefits of the programme. He recalled that Bagudu recently led members of RIFAN to the Presidential Villa to present membership card to Buhari. In his response, the governor commended their gesture of purchasing nomination form for the President and for mobilising members nationwide to embark on massive rice production. Bagudu applauded Buhari for giving rice and wheat farmers necessary financial support and input to sustain cultivation, adding: “With this development, a date will soon be fixed for members representing all the states to converge on Abuja to present the nomination form to the President.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
