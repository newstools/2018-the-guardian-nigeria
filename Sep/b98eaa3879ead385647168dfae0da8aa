Franklin, who grew up singing in her father’s church and seized on her explosive voice to fuel songs such as Respect and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, died on August 16 from cancer. For her public viewing in her home of Detroit, she was dressed in a different outfit each of the three days.
