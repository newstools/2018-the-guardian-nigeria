“It should also be viewed as the symbolic beginning of a concerted, deliberate and coordinated initiative at mainstreaming the community,” he said. He stressed that excluding a community with an estimated population of over 25 million from the political process, amounted to denying the nation the needed contribution of the critical mass in the task of nation building.He also said it was a dent on the country’s domestic and international commitment to respecting and promoting the human rights of all citizens. The document revolves around the rights of eligible PWDs to vote, be voted for and hold elective offices, among others, while further expanding their access to the electoral process by placing responsibilities and obligations on the Election Management Body (EMB) to provide assistive materials, as well as ensure friendly and compliant environment and processes for PWDs.
