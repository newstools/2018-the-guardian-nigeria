After his This is America hit that shook the world, Childish Gambino, the stage name of Donald Glover, released two songs in July. Inspired by summer, the multitalented star has released the music video for one of them: Feels Like Summer. <img class="size-full wp-image-731672 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Childish-Gambino-Summer-e1535932975295.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="813" /> The animated music video sees Gambino strolling casually through a neighbourhood filled with
the biggest and brightest hip-hop talents, including 21 Savage, Migos, Will Smith, Travis Scott who knocks over Nicki Minaj’s building blocks, and Future who steals Drake’s bike. The video was directed by Glover, Ivan Dixon and Greg Sharp, with illustrations from Justin Richburg.
