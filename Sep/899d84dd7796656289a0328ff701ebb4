Nike has in the past used controversial figures to push its campaigns. They have yet again taken the risk and used controversial player Colin Kaepernick who knelt down during the US national anthem as a protest against the brutal killing of black men by the police. This is not the first time that Nike will face backlash for its strong ad campaigns. They had been accused of having double standards in their “Equality Campaign” in 2017 as people claimed that Nike staff were poorly treated in their factories in some countries. But their decision to shroud themselves in yet another controversy is in some people’s opinion becoming a signature. Some Nike fans have expressed their thoughts on the campaign while some see nothing wrong in using Colin Kaepernick, others have strongly voiced their thoughts in dramatic actions like burning their Nike sneakers. Here are some of the reactions on Twitter:  I don’t see kneeling as disrespect for our armed forces or veterans. It is a statement about the discrimination, prejudices, and injustices that still age American Society. @Nike & @Kaepernick7 are on the right side of history. #TakeAKnee — Wes Clark (@GeneralClark) September 5, 2018  pic.twitter.com/gDo23WWy8Z — Isabella (@isabella6144) September 6, 2018  “If Nike is ashamed of America, we are ashamed of them.” https://t.co/W7qvPhw1K2 via @BleacherReport — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) September 6, 2018  I am going to buy Nike this weekend.
