In a very late statement last night, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) confirmed that it would today hold its governorship primaries in all 36 States except Lagos, Kano and Imo. A statement released by PDP national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, reads: “The attention of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has just been drawn to rumour making the rounds that the PDP scheduled gubernatorial primaries have been postponed. “The PDP wishes to inform all delegates, members of our great party and aspirants for the gubernatorial elections that the scheduled date for the primary remains Sunday, September 30, 2018. “The rumour about the postponement should therefore be disregarded completely.” “However, the gubernatorial primary election dates for Lagos, Kano and Imo states would be announced soon.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
