 Riders competing for honours in a recent West African championship held in Lagos. The Schools Cycling Challenge is aimed at unearthing talents for the country.  President, African Cycling Foundation, the organisers of the competition, Mr. Yemi Osilaja said the platform was established to get young students into cycling as it increases students’ alertness. He added, “Cycling involves every bit of the body, especially the brain and the heart. This will help the students develop more in their skills and also in their studies. “ACF gives out free bicycles to the youths, especially those in the rural areas because our aim is to get to the grassroots, get the talents, develop them and aid them to compete at the highest level.” The Secondary School Challenge, he said, would be in two categories, including senior male and female and junior male and female, adding that the participants were picked through their education districts. “The districts will choose their representatives; the participants are coming not to represent their various schools but their districts. We want to use the districts before going down to the schools, which are many,” he said. Also speaking at the event, the Director of the Lagos State Sports Commission, Dr. Kweku Tandoh, represented by the commission’s Assistant Director, Rahmon Lanre said the competition would provide an avenue to nurture talents, especially those in public schools for the state. “Lagos State Sports Commission is known for developing talents and young minds from the grassroots. And it is not only in cycling but all sports.  This is why the Commission is partnering with AFC to make the third edition a reality,” he said.
