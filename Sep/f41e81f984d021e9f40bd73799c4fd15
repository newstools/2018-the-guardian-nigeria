As Burna Boy continues to give us hit after hit, we joyously travel down the rabbit hole with him. Gbona is a politically conscious track, in which Burna Boy subtly addresses the direct relativity of one’s wealth to their respectability. There is also the reminder to enjoy oneself and ’Jeun soke’ when the opportunity presents itself, but always stay sharp.

The visuals work with Burna’s lyrics to reinforce beauty, strength, and resilience. Enjoy:
