In a heated atmosphere, 84 deputies voted in favor of the new prime minister while five voted against, and four abstained. Haiti’s Senate had approved the new government’s general policies following a more than 15-hour session that concluded early on Saturday, with it then being put to a vote of confidence at the Chamber of Deputies. A notary by training who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2010 and 2016, Ceant was named to the post by President Jovenel Moise on August 5. But in a sign of discord between the legislative and presidential branches, it took a month to reach agreement on his 18-member cabinet. Tension remains high in Haiti after a series of riots against rising fuel prices gripped Port-au-Prince in July that forced the resignation of prime minister Jack Guy Lafontant. Mass protests which turned deadly erupted on July 6 after a government unveiled major fuel price hikes — 38 percent for gasoline, 47 percent for diesel and 51 percent for kerosene.
