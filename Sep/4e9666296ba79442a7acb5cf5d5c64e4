With Pan-Asian restaurants popping up every other block, it’s important for establishments that specialise in this cuisine to set themselves apart. While I prefer the taste and service to be the distinguishable element, many often go with décor. However, POW Restaurant, at No. 5 Bangui Street, Ist Floor, Food City, Wuse 2, Abuja, found a balance between the two. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-741363 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-487x365.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-974x731.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_93391-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The space itself is minimalistic oriental, with dark, wooden furniture, climbing plants, raffia mats, and the see-through space dividers. I wasn’t pleased with the seating arrangement, considering there were not a lot of private dining options available. All the benches and tables are arranged booth-style, with the tables being separated to accommodate a couple or a group. On a busy day, you most likely won’t get the privacy you and a partner need if you go on a date here. Guess this is the price you pay for minimalism. Fried Basil Rice and Szechuan Chicken The menu contained a nice balance of pan-Asian options, ranging from sushi to the staple rice with seafood and meat variants of their sauces–which I appreciated. I ordered the Beef Basil rice, the large Szechuan Chicken, and a glass of Lemongrass and Ginger Iced Tea. I was a little disappointed because it was too small even though it was supposed to be shared between two people.  Portion aside, I had no qualms with the chicken. It was spicy without being overwhelming and complimented the rice well. I hunted for the beef with the rice, but I guess they invested more in the taste than the protein. Also, they took out the onions from my Szechuan chicken on my request, so that is a plus in my book. Szechuan Chicken, Lemongrass and Ginger Tea To wash my meal down, I had a refreshing glass of Lemongrass and Ginger Iced Tea. I had ordered this on a whim and was impressed by how refreshing it was. Ice to liquid ratio was on point, the ginger was just the right amount to give that little tingle we sometimes enjoy, and the lemongrass was refreshing. In summary, POW is one place I would dine at again. The prices are fair–if you ignore the service charge and VAT and something they called a VIP charge — and they have enough variations to pique one’s interests. Price Box Szechuan chicken:  4000 Beef basil fried rice:  1300 Lemongrass and ginger iced tea:  1500
