Afrobeats rising star Willie XO is becoming a master in the art of churning out not just top quality dancehall music, but also top-notch videos. From his first single Kraze to his latest Slow, the singer seems to be leaving no stone unturned in his quest to hit limelight. His brand of music, which he described as ‘afrovibes,’ combines R&B with Afrobeats, plus that baritone voice that can’t go unnoticed in both singles he has released so far. When Willie XO’s first single Kraze hit town, it won instant acceptance in Nigeria and worldwide earning rave reviews. In fact, top American singer and songwriter Ashanti rocked the song and endorsed it saying, “I love this song.” Kraze, shot in Hollywood in the United States, also got airplay on top Nigerian radio stations and mentions on social media and crossed one million views on YouTube. However, Willie XO’s latest visual, Slow, is barely two weeks since released and has reached 1.3 million views on YouTube. The video was shot and directed by Daps at the luxurious resort Geejam Hotel, in Port Antonio, Jamaica. Meanwhile, last year when he dropped Kraze, the singer visited home amid warm reception from scores of his fans, who have been following his rising profile, since his first single dropped. As usual, the music act was cladded in head to toe Gucci designed clothing, bling bling, a head banner, and to top it up, he had on his wrist a diamond encrusted Patek Philippe Geneva. It was almost chaos at the international wing of the Murtala Mohammed Airport in Lagos, as the singer passed the airport lobby on his way out. Already, fans are anticipating that, with the release of his latest single, Willie XO might just be on his way back to Nigeria once again.
