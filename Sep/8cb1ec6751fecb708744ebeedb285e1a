Mr. Seni Adio The former Vice President of the Nigerian Bar Association Section on Business Law (NBA-SBL), Seni Adio (SAN), has been inaugurated as the new chair of the session, alongside other members of the new executive. The executive council now has Ayuli Jemide as the new vice chair, with Dr. Adeoye Adefulu, as Secretary. Others include, Chinyere Okorocha, treasurer, Okey Egbuchu as the adviser on communications, while Mena Ajakpovi is for Research & Training. A. Abubakar, Omubo Frank-Briggs and Ama Etuwewe are to operate as Zonal officers of North, East and West. The new chairman, while giving his remarks, promised to do his best to match and do even more than what has already been done by his predecessors to bring SBL to its current state. He also thanked his predecessors for a job well done. Before the inauguration, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, noted that a developmental state paradigm is the only way to achieve sustainable development in Nigeria. According to him, the developmental state paradigm has some elements which include a strong commitment to property rights, strong markets and the sanctity of contracts – a mix that never fails to assure foreign investors. “As the term implies, development is of utmost national priority, even though the state may sometimes tend to be rather authoritarian in nature; land reforms and so on,” he stated. He attributed the poor performance of Africa in the economy to many factors such as bad leadership, cultural mindset and historical background among others. The new executive council was inaugurated during the session, which featured other speakers such as Dr. Joseph Abah, Mrs. Toyin Bashir, Prof. Anthony Kila and Dr. Ayo Teriba.
