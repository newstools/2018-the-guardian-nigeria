The political climate has been intense recently as Osun state prepared to decide who will take over the office of the governor. Political parties have been busy with campaigns and top contenders have traded members in a bid to strengthen their cause. Emotions have run high as Nigerians await the official declaration of the winner by INEC. As they patiently wait, some have not hesitated to voice their thoughts via Twitter. <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>All my friends, enemies and subbers currently in Osun, please make sure to buy bread, akara and dodo ikire before you go back to base. Help improve Osun’s economy. Thanks and God bless </p>&mdash; Dr. Dípò Awojide (@OgbeniDipo) <a href=”https://twitter.com/OgbeniDipo/status/1043765486780141568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>September 23, 2018</a></blockquote>

Someone who hasn't done anything meaningful since he got to the NASS. W for Wow. — Nimah A (@MsNemah) September 23, 2018  Osun went from N5B debt profile when Aregbesola took over to almost N150B with IGR of N1.5B and you say he's done well? May dog chop your mouth. — Trophy Husband. (@femiDNL) September 23, 2018  If pdp wins, then shame on osun people, their education is a waste. They preferred Ajobiewe with f9 parallel to a chatered accountant as governor. They should not worry, jukeboxes and concert centers fall on you. pic.twitter.com/M1mlRNMUi1 — Naija BDM (@OluSeyiOjeleye) September 23, 2018  I hope those of you supporting candidates in mushroom parties can see that 2019 elections will be a battle between APC and PDP? The results from Osun do not have tangible votes from Moghalu, Sowore or Fela Durotoye's parties. Pls get serious if you want to vote out Buhari. — SavePlateauLives (@faith_anza) September 23, 2018  I feel sorry for whoever wins Osun. Aregbesola has left behind a huge mess. In fact, I don't understand why any party would want to govern Osun. It's a financial basket case. In a normal country, the state would have been taken over by the FG.#OsunDecides2018 — Gege (@nigeriasbest) September 23, 2018  Nigeria will be liberated in 2019. N17billion officially released by Buhari. Over N27billion was pumped into the state in 2weeks.14 APC Governors on ground in Osun.Asiwaju Tinubu on ground with his ATM. And yet they could not manipulate Osun by wide margin. — Adeyanju Deji  (@adeyanjudeji) September 23, 2018  Finally! Osogbo LGA APC 23379PDP 14499 Done and Dusted.  PDP officially wins Osun. Congratulations  Senator Adeleke. What I'm yet to understand is the reason why people voted for APC in the first place. I mean do people like slavery and suffering?#OsunDecides2018 — BONA LEO (@bonaleo4u) September 23, 2018
