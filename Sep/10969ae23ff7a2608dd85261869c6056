The Rivers government has fingered the Minister of Transportation, Chubuike Rotimi Amaechi, as the mastermind of the crisis rocking the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Commissioner for Information and Communications, Emma Okah, said if the minister could drop his “dictatorship tendencies”, he would realise that he is behind the imbroglio and not Governor Nyesom Wike. Okah spoke in Port Harcourt while reacting to Amaechi’s claim during a rally in Obio/Akpor Council that the governor was panic-stricken and had been sponsoring APC members to cause confusion within the party. The commissioner said the party’s current predicament emanated from the minister’s insistence that a “serving senator has no right to aspire to be governor of Rivers State and the unilateral appointment of his Lagos business partner as the preferred governorship candidate without regard to the right of other APC members to contest party primaries.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
