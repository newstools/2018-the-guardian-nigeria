Rihanna celebrated women of every shape, size and colour in a shocking show unveiling her Savage X Fenty lingerie line, bringing New York Fashion Week to a juddering climax. The Barbadian superstar stepped out in a figure-hugging coffee dress and sunglasses, smiling and waving to the huge crowd that packed into the Brooklyn Naval Yard. If there was a theme it was anything goes, be any kind of woman, be beautiful however you are, and Rihanna has all your underwear needs covered â€” be it tomboy boxers, sexy thongs or nipple-bearing one pieces. The models danced and writhed on the astroturf podium, covered in plants, for nearly 30 minutes, their figures casting long shadows when they stepped in and out of nylon bubble tents. From femme fatale to pregnant women to girl next door lounging in nice soft pyjamas, the underwear garments came in every shape, colour and size, worn with matching silk gloves up to the elbow. Supermodel Bella Hadid, in baby blue, towered above some of the shorter women, holding hands with them at the end. Fall/winter 2018, the collection was available to purchase immediately.
