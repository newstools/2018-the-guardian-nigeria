Deputy governor of Imo state, Prince Eze Madumere The Imo state High Court sitting in Owerri on Tuesday declared the impeachment of deputy governor of the state, Eze Madumere, as invalid and of no legal effect. The judge, Justice Benjamin Iheaka, in his ruling which lasted for over two hours, faulted the Chief Judge of the state, Paschal Nnadi and the Attorney General of the state, Militus Nlemadim for not following the provisions of section 188(5) of the 1999 constitution as amended in the impeachment of Madumere on July 31,2018. The jurist contended that the CJ constituted the seven-man panel to investigate the allegations of gross misconduct by Madumere outside the seven days lifeline as provided by the constitution. Recall that Madumere was impeached by 19 of the 37 members of the Imo House of Assembly on July, 30. The lawmakers had earlier received a report by a panel set up by the state chief judge which allegedly indicted Mr Madumere of gross misconduct. Madumere has been having a running political scuffle with the state Governor, Rochas Okorocha who reportedly supports his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu to succeed him rather than Madumere.
