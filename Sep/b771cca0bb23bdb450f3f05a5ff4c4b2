The long-prophesied apocalypse provides a definite for believers in the sense of a termination of evil. Not so as we face the realities of the outside world. The narratives of mainstream and social media almost certainly project the absence of an end. Science has taken over. Faith is a private affair. Faith is to be shelved once we enter the public space.  There is a clash therefore, never resolved to eternal or universal satisfaction. Until we obey the final whistle of humanity we may not holistically answer the questions. Perhaps it is never meant to be. So we create our small world and remain in the cocoon till eternity. Why should our knowledge of things and things-to-come be absolute? How then may we accept how infinitesimal we are in the immensity of the cosmological order?  We accept that which fits into our imagination and received knowledge and chart a course till our appointment with the current phase of existence comes to an end. Within the broad concept of time ours is very narrow and small, measured in decades which after seven usually begins to savage our physical composition.
