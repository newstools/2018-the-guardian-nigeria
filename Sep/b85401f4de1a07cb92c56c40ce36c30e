An All Progressives Congress (APC) House of Representatives aspirant for Ede Federal Constituency in Osun State, Saheed Lasisi yesterday called for youth empowerment to reduce the high level of employment and restiveness. Speaking with The Guardian, Lasisi, who is also a chartered accountant, said that if Nigerian leaders empower the youths adequately, the country’s problems would be solved. He stressed further that unemployment is a major issue in Nigeria. Lasisi, who is from Sekona town in Ede, said he came into politics to serve humanity, adding that his five-point agenda or core manifesto would impact positively on the people. According to him, “My areas of focus would include youth engagement, women empowerment, establishment of cottage industries to convert our farm produces to semi and finished goods, influencing constituency projects to various communities and awards of scholarships to deserving students who are from poor backgrounds.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
