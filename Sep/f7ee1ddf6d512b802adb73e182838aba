Joe Ajaero •Ties poor wage to greed, corruption in governance
With twenty-four to the deadline given by organised labour to the Federal Government to announce a new national minimum of N65,000, the movement has urged Nigerians to stockpile food and other necessities given what it described as government’s “known intransigence and insensitivity to the collective plight of the people.” Rising from an emergency Central Working Committee (CWC) meeting yesterday in Lagos, the president of United Labour Congress (ULC), Joe Ajaero regretted that government was yet to neither “respond sensibly and positively to workers’ demands nor show any sign that suggests otherwise.” According to him, the new pay demand was desirable and possible only if government could be patriotic for once by cutting perks of political appointments and others in positions of leadership as well as shed off the toga of greed and corruption. Labour, in a communiqué issued at the end of the gathering, argued that a living wage becomes possible when security votes, heavy convoys and political appointees are removed from the system to allow for reduction in the cost of governance. It therefore ordered all affiliates and state councils nationwide to mobilise for the nationwide strike. Ajaero noted that government was still playing politics with the lives and living conditions of Nigerians, especially workers. He said: “Labour shall no longer be obliged by this time to give any further notice to the government before embarking on the needed action to resist the deliberate and unconscionable desolation of our people and nation.” However, the Central Working Committee (CWC) of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) said it had empowered the National Administrative Council (NAC) and its leadership to carry out all necessary actions in conjunction with other stakeholders to ensure the achievement of the new minimum wage.
