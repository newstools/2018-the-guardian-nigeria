My first visit to Pancake Hub was one of sheer delight. Imagine finding a quiet space that serves a wonderful breakfast menu in the heart of a vibrant area. Soon enough visiting Pancake Hub at 17 Jibowu street became a thing. As with all things in life, change is constant and my visits became less frequent until one cool Wednesday morning. As I tried to avoid the traffic building at Ojuelegba connecting to Mushin, I remembered my old friend and decided that a late breakfast will be in order. I arrived and the kitchen visible from the dining area looked busy. I customised my meal, and I ordered the pancake breakfast meal which comprises two pancakes, scrambled eggs and sausages, and a side of meatball combo and a medium-sized lemonade. Pancake Hub The attendee told me my order will be ready in seven minutes, but it arrived in less. I should have known something was amiss with the promptness of my order. The meatball combo came after, so I used my indecision on a perfect dining spot to while away the time, and it arrived. Pancake Hub makes one of the best pancakes I’ve ever had the privilege of eating in Lagos and this meal was no disappointment. However, the scrambled eggs and sausages were cold. This turned me off from the meal as it cemented the fact that the meal was not prepared with me in mind. Considering the timeframe I received my order, I expected my plate to be piping hot. The meatball combo was the perfect addition to this meal, it was hot and spicy and went well with the meal. Looking at the menu, I had expected the lemonade to be homemade, instead; I received a branded bottle, which annoyed me. I did not enjoy my meal as I thought I’d have. Between my cold eggs and fighting off flies, my experience at Pancake Hub made me nostalgic for the old days when I visited the hub. Will I be going back? For now, it is a hard no for me.
