He, therefore, charged parents and guardians to step up effort in giving good parental attention to their children/wards in the early stages of their life. For the commitment shown in partnering with NDLEA to enlighten members of the public on the dangers of illicit drug, the agency boss commended president of the Drug Salvation Foundation, Wilson Ighodalo, for his unrelenting posture even as he encouraged him to do more for the sake of Nigerian youths. The four persons inducted and presented with certificates were Mr. Odita Sunday; a correspondent with The Guardian newspaper; Mr. Iruvwe Okeremute Don, a comedian; Mrs. Queen Blessing Ebigieson, a Nollywood actor and film producer; and Mr. Herbert Olufemi Samuel, a media practitioner. Ighodalo said the idea of bringing celebrities on board as members of the club was for them to serve as role models to youths who were the most vulnerable in the illicit drugs and substance abuse indulgence.
