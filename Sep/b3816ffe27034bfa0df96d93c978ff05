The investments include the $1.5 billion Lekki Deep Seaport; 650,000-barrel per day (bpd) Dangote Refinery; and the Lekki Free Trade Zone that will accommodate more than 48 companies.  So, we have written the Nigerian Railway Corporation to ensure that there is a rail connection.
   
“The same way we have written the Dangote Refinery to have pipeline evacuation of liquids out of the refinery in Lekki, so that you don’t have trucks parking, and looking for where to pick products from the refinery. There is also a proposed Lekki By-Pass in addition to the road that Lagos State is constructing, linking Lekki to Shagamu.
   
“So, one, there must be pipelines for product evacuation; two, there must be rail connection; three, there must be additional means of road transportation, and the Lagos access road also need to be prioritised. So, we need to work to have some sanity in five years’ time. If we do not deploy what is required now, in five to 10 years’ time, Lekki will be unmanageable. I am a believer of starting something; even if you do not finish it, start it.” The Deep Seaport is primed to become one of the largest deep water ports in sub-Sahara Africa as the promoters are targeting about 1.5 million 20ft equivalent units container capacity yearly, which is expected to grow to about 2.7million and 4.7million TEUs, when operations commence.
