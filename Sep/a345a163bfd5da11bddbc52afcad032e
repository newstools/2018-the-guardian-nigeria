Nigeria is as interesting as it is fascinating. One of her capabilities is the ability to attribute meaning to words, behind its original meaning, or create new words entirely. Some of these distinctive words and phrases are commonly used while conversing. Here are some of the very familiar and interesting ones: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-749994 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jay-Z-shares-a-greeting-with-a-friend.-Photo-Blavity.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="872" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jay-Z-shares-a-greeting-with-a-friend.-Photo-Blavity.jpg 700w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jay-Z-shares-a-greeting-with-a-friend.-Photo-Blavity-487x332.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jay-Z-shares-a-greeting-with-a-friend.-Photo-Blavity-320x218.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jay-Z-shares-a-greeting-with-a-friend.-Photo-Blavity-640x436.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jay-Z-shares-a-greeting-with-a-friend.-Photo-Blavity-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Originally, how far was as a way to check up on an ongoing situation. However, how far is now used as a way of greeting, as opposed to ‘hello or hi’. It could mean, how are you? How have you been? This here is a plus because it is technically a reply to ‘how far?’. It also emphasises the extent of how well you are. On this note, it is alright to say: I dey oh, I just dey. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-749959 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25.png" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25.png 1200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25-897x598.png 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25-487x325.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25-974x649.png 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25-320x213.png 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25-640x427.png 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-25-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /> Usually, the phrase ‘as in’ is a question that begs for more clarification on whatever is being talked about. However, this is not the case here. Hence, ‘as in eh’ means ‘very true’ or ‘your assertion is correct’. The addition of the ‘eh’, qualifies the agreement. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-749983 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-466x598.png" alt="" width="1100" height="1411" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-466x598.png 466w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-898x1152.png 898w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-434x557.png 434w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-868x1114.png 868w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-187x240.png 187w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-374x480.png 374w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-26-468x600.png 468w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /> This phrase has the ability to accept a new meaning as the day progresses including saying goodbyes. Initially, oya na was a phrase popular to the Yoruba’s which means “hurry up” until it began to be used to refer to other things. The difference in its meanings is observed in the cadence while pronouncing. Oya na could mean okay, do whatever you want to do, answer me, let’s go, take care and so many others. It sounds very funny, yes. This is a sarcastic way of telling someone to quit self-hyping himself. This here and ‘be feeling yourself’ practically have the same meaning.
