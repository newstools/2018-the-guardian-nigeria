The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has allayed fears of possible petroleum products scarcity across the country, following an ultimatum issued by the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) over a purported intervention by an arm of the security agencies in what the union viewed as purely labour matters involving a company and its workers in Delta State. NNPC’s Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Ndu Ughamadu, in a statement yesterday in Abuja, said the corporation’s Group Managing Director, Maikanti Baru, and his management team were engaging the parties involved and the parties were close to resolving the issues. Ughamadu advised motorists and other consumers of petroleum products not to engage in panic buying, as the NNPC management was close to reaching an amicable resolution of the challenge.The corporation assured that it had adequate storage of petroleum products across the country and advised the public not to entertain any fear of petroleum shortages.
