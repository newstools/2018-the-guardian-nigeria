 Governor Abiola Ajimobi<br />  Ajimobi disclosed his intention at the maiden General Abdulsalami Abubakar Foundation Peace Lecture held at the Trenchard Hall of the University of Ibadan. “You know I am running for the Senate. So, I went to Abuja for the screening exercise of our party and just returned yesterday,’’ Ajimobi said. The two-term governor of Oyo State had from 2003 to 2007 represented the same senatorial district in the National Assembly on the platform of Alliance for Democracy (AD). Ajimobi, aware that his two terms in office may determine his return to the Senate, also took the opportunity to highlight the achievements of his administration in the last seven years. The aspiring senator will be contesting the ruling party’s senatorial ticket against another aspirant, Fola Akinosun. If he emerges the party flagbearer, he will contest against the constituency incumbent Senator, Adesoji Akanbi, who had dumped the APC for African Democratic Congress (ADC). The governor, however, believed his performance as the State’s governor in the past 7years will earn him a place in the Senate come 2019.
