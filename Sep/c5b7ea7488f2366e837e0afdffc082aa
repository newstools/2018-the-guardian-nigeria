 Buhari with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.  To build an even closer China-African community with a shared future in the new era, President Xi Jinping announced that China will, on the basis of the ten cooperation plans already adopted, launch eight major initiatives in close collaboration with African countries in the next three years and beyond. The eight initiatives are: Industrial promotion, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, health care, people-to-people, peace and security. In these eight initiatives, many measures are designed to help African youths. For example, in capacity building initiative, China will set up 10 Luban Workshops to provide vocational training; A China-Africa innovation cooperation center aims at promoting youth innovation and entrepreneurship will be set up; A tailor made program will be carried out to train 1000 high- caliber Africans, 50000 government scholarships, 50000 training opportunities for seminars and workshops as well as 2000 exchange opportunities for African youth will be provided. To make sure these eight initiatives are implemented on the ground, China will extend 60 billion U.S. dollars financing to Africa in different forms which includes 15 billion U.S. dollars’ grants, interest- free loans and concessional loans. China will also encourage Chinese companies to invest more than 10 billion U.S. dollars in Africa in the coming three years. China and African countries are destined to be good friends, good brothers and good partners. China-Africa relations have demonstrated unprecedented solidarity, vitality and creativity, which offers significant opportunities to both sides. This also applies to China Nigeria relations. Nigeria is China’s important strategic partner. With the joint efforts of the two sides, the two countries have gained fruitful achievements from friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields.
