A lot of people might not know the group, The New Dakotas but Malia Obama, America’s former first daughter sure does and even appeared on their music video lip-syncing  and playing the harmonica. This group’s songs have not really made a splash yet on Spotify, their most poppular song was listened to a little more than 2,000 times and their music video had 1,500 views on YouTube. The group attends Havard University where Malia Obama also attends.
The song in which she appears ‘Walking on Air’ however has gotten much more than their previous numbers.
The sisters Malia and Sasha are known to keep a low profile despite having an ex president of the US as their father.
