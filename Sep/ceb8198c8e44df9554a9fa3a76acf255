The singer is being tipped as a likely Golden Globe and Oscar contender, after earning rave reviews. But Gaga says the ‘artistic experience of creating this film is reward enough. Lady Gaga's performance as an aspiring singer who makes it big in A Star is Born has earned rave reviews and she is being tipped as a likely Golden Globe and Oscar contender. But Gaga on Thursday evening (September 27) at a red carpet event in London a played down the accolades. "That would be wonderful, but the reward for me is in the artistic experience of creating this film. All we can hope for is that the film touches people's lives," she told Reuters. In her first film role, the New York-born musician behind hits Born This Way and Bad Romance plays a struggling singer called Ally who has a chance meeting and intense romance with country star Jackson Maine, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper, co co-produced and sung some of the songs with Gaga in the film, ruled out a sideline career as a singer-songwriter. Asked whether it was his time to win an Oscar, after being nominated in the past, the debut director of "A Star is Born" said: "It would be amazing to be nominated again, it would be amazing if not nominated and the movie does well." "I'm just so relieved that I'm here, talking to you and the movie's finished," he added. Gaga, 32, said when she started out at 19, she spent time "dragging her piano around New York City, banging on doors." She soared to fame 10 years ago with catchy dance songs, provocative outfits and elaborate stage shows that brought her six Grammy Awards. "A Star is Born" begins its worldwide rollout on Oct. 3.
