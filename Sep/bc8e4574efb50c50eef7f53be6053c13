Orezi follows up his catchy new single ‘Weke’ with a fun video. Directed by Paul Gambit, the video is bright and colourful; from the set and props to the costumes. In true dancehall spirit, Orezi doesn’t hesitate to show off some of his classic moves. A special treat is seeing Daddy Showkey make a cameo appearance and dancing with the Gehn Gehn Music Entertainment artiste. See the video below.
