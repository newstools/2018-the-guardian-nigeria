We all know that there is a difference between parents and, African parents. Well, to be more specific, Nigerian parents. This Sir or Ma, mummy/daddy as we call them is a rare breed whose definition of parenting is totally different and funny and annoying (sometimes). Here are some of the few annoying things they do to those of us who are fortunate enough to be their offspring. They attribute the cause of a recent failure to something you did… If you haven’t been told that the reason you came fourth in class is because you stayed for long in Bisola’s house 5 years ago then you are very lucky. Nigerian parents go overboard like that. Meme of a man crying They tell you the reason you now have your own opinion is because you are growing boobs or beards… Girls can relate to this, even guys! You tell them the reason why the TV remote is not working is because it needs a new battery, they say the reason you ‘know better’, is because you have started growing beards or breasts or developing hips. Other times, it is during a confrontation, when they are beating you to a pulp and you raise your hands in self-defense (wrong move) never do that or else, you will hear; “so you think you can beat me now because of your chest.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-748446 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-974x974.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-600x600.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.jpg 992w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />  Shut up, just shut up, what you say doesn’t matter, they don’t want to listen to it and they don’t care. You did it and that is the beginning and end of the conversation. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-748444 size-medium lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-1062x598.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2-600x338.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /> Why all this? Social media can sometimes be a betrayer; they expose a side of you your parents should not see. Even if your parents are not on social media, nosy family members will not let you be great. Kuku kee me Ah, yes, Nigerian parents have zero chill. They can easily ‘remind’ to go and wash the toilet or plates or your 2 days old soaked bread spread in front of your friends and they do not do it nicely. <img class="wp-image-748450 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock.jpg 1000w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-974x974.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Shuttershock-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Meme.

They can wake you up to come and taste if there is salt is in the food or to pass the remote. Their ‘show you off’ time, they can call you from anywhere, at any time to come and greet mummy Iyabo or Daddy G.O just because they want to brag about all the accomplishments they never tell you they are proud of in person. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-748467 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen-766x598.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="781" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen-766x598.jpg 766w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen-487x380.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen-974x761.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen-307x240.jpg 307w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen-614x480.jpg 614w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen-600x469.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Meme.-Photo-Yen.jpg 996w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />
