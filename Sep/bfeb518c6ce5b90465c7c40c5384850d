The Lagos State police command yesterday said it had arrested a policeman caught on camera holding a bottle of beer while on duty. The Guardian had on its Panorama section on page two of yesterday’s edition published a picture of a policeman holding a bottle of beer while on duty. However, the command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), CSP Chike Oti, in a statement issued yesterday disclosed that the policeman, identified as Inspector Emmanuel Egba, had been arrested. The statement clarified that contrary to the report, Inspector Egba is a police motorcycle rider attached to Area ‘M’ command, Idimu and not Rapid Response Squad (RRS). The statement further stated that on interrogation, the officer denied the allegation stating that he recovered the beer bottle with liquid contents from a driver who was drinking right inside his car in traffic. It added that the officer posited that he feared that the driver might get himself intoxicated thereby endangering his life and that of other road users. “The attention of the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Edgal Imohimi, has been drawn to a publication on page two of the Guardian Newspaper of Wednesday September 12, 2018, in which a police inspector was caught on camera holding a bottle of beer. “The case is, however, being investigated at the Command Provost Section and if his claim is found to be false, appropriate disciplinary action would be meted out to him after an Orderly Room Trial”, the statement said.
