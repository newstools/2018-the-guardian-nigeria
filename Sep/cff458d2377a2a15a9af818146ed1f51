Abba picked his nomination and expression of interest forms at the National Secretariat of the APC in Abuja. He told newsmen that he was in the race to bring quality representation to his constituents and contribute meaningfully to national development. Abba was appointed as acting IGP on August 1, 2014, by former President Goodluck Jonathan and later confirmed as substantive IGP on November 4, 2014. After leaving office as IGP, Abba was accused of conspiring with then APC presidential aspirant Muhammadu Buhari of rendering a weak security system in the country. The former IGP in recent interviews said his non-confirmation as IGP by former president Jonathan was because he failed to deliver the 2014 Osun state governorship election to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “One of the leading stalwarts in the PDP then said to me, IG (you know I was acting then) deliver Osun to us and we will confirm you quickly,” Abba said. “I was shocked! That was when I knew that I may not last long in the office. Immediately, I said to myself, “How could I deliver when I am not an electorate?” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
