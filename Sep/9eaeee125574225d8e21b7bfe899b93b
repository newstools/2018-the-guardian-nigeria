But her travel ban was only recently lifted amid a thaw in relations between Ankara and Berlin.

The PKK has waged a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey since 1984. It is blacklisted as a terror organisation by Ankara and its Western allies. “Divergent political opinions are no justification for arrests and intimidation, which are happening more and more in Turkey,” Reporters without Borders in Austria said in a statement. Austria’s foreign ministry confirmed the arrest of an Austrian national, without providing further details. Rights organisations have frequently criticised Turkey for its violations of press freedom, which have stepped up since a failed coup attempt in July 2016. Turkey ranked 157 out of 180 countries in the 2018 World Press Freedom index published by RSF.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
