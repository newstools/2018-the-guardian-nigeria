Wouldn’t we all love to get paid just to sleep? Well that is exactly what Terry Laurmen is doing. The 75 year old who is a volunteer at Wisconsin Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary in Green Bay has what can only be described as the perfect job and it involves volunteering at his local cat shelter, snoozing off in corners while cuddling kitties.

In just the last two days, the shelter has raised more than $30,000. Elizabeth Feldhausen, the founder of Wisconsin Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary in Green Bay said: “People have been donating $1, $2 or $5 dollars. It’s been so many people that they’ve made such a huge impact by doing something so small.” Terry Laurmen | Image Source: CNN According to Laurmen, a retired high school Spanish teacher, he walked in the shelter, brush in hand, and began grooming the cats. He said the reason he chose this shelter is its “homey” environment. “They don’t have cages and I much prefer socializing the cats in a more natural situation. He just became a volunteer. He knows who all the cats were,” Feldhausen said. “He just enjoys cats so much. It seems like they’re his passion in life.” A few days ago, the shelter posted a gallery of his best nap pictures and the internet loved it. More than $30,000 have poured in proving once again the power of naps.
