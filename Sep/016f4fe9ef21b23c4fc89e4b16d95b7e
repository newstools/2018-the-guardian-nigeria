The other plaintiffs in the suit dated September 19, 2018 are Mr. Daniel David Kadzai and Lift-Up-Now Incorporation, a non-governmental organization in the United States of America.

Among the prayers being sought by the plaintiffs are an order directing and mandating the defendants to secure the immediate and unconditional release of Leah from the custody of her captors, and an order compelling the defendants to employ every means in securing her release. The plaintiffs are also seeking an order compelling the defendants to pay N500 million being compensation for the indignities and human deprivations suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendantsâ€™ dereliction of statutory duties in securing her release from her captors since February, 2018 till date. According to the suit, the defendants may enter appearance personally or by a legal practitioner either by filing the appropriate processes in response at the registry of the court, where the summons was issued, or by sending them to that office by any methods allowed by these rules. It added that if the defendant does not respond within the stipulated time and at the appropriate place, order will be made and proceedings may be taken as the judge may think just and expedient.
