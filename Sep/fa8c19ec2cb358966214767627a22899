Barely four days to the Osun state gubernatorial election, the Nigerian police Wednesday filed a four-count charge against People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke. The police, in a Federal High Court in Abuja, charged him for examination malpractice, aiding and abetting, impersonation, and criminal conspiracy. The force alleged that Ademola and his brother Sikiru Adeleke registered and sat for the National Examination Council Examination (NECO) 2017 as internal candidates, impersonating students of the school at the ages of 57 and 42 years respectively. The Force Public Relations Officer, Jimoh Moshood, on Wednesday told newsmen that investigations revealed that that  Ademola had made a cautionary statement and admitted that he registered for the 2017 NECO examinations as an internal student in the said school but did not sit for the examination. Moshood explained further that both the Senator and his brother Sikiru Adeleke’ s pictures were captured in the school’s photo book of 2017 but no NECO seal was found on their photos, unlike the rest of the students. The School Principal of Ojo-Aro Community High School, Egbedore Local Government Area, Osun State, and three others are also to be arraigned for what the force describes as a conspiracy with the Senator.
