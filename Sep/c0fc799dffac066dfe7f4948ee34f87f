Some registered voters of Orolu community in Disu Oke-Odo area, ward 7, Kajola road in Osun state were on Thursday prevented by some heavily armed political thugs from accessing their polling units to cast their votes in the ongoing supplementary election in the state. The alleged thugs were said to be shooting sporadically to scare away voters despite the presence of Nigeria police. The angry protesters alleged that they were stopped from getting to the polling units to exercising their franchise. The returning officer of the unit also said they were chased out of the unit by the fully armed thugs. Details later.
