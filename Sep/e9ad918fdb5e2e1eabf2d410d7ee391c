The programme is supported by Association for Progressive Communication (APC). She said that inclusiveness of women and acquisition of the knowledge of the Internet was key to their development. “And these are the things the forum wants the women to be part of in the internet governance process.’’ She said that to bridge the gap, the forum drew up women focus programmes to enable them express themselves, participate fully and voice up their opinions. “The essence of this meeting is for capacity building and for bringing information to the women and showing them the areas they have right and authority to speak out. “And for them to participate in the development process, the internet is the platform as this is the enabler for everybody to be inclusive. “This programme is the first step of involving women in internet governance. “We have brought women together, spoken to them, stimulated them and educated them to know they have a platform to voice out their minds,’’ she said. Prof. Amina Kaidal, a board member of CITAD said that the focus for the programme was to bring women together to identify problems hindering them from the internet process. Kaidal, who is also a lecturer at University of Maiduguri said that the forum would strategise on how to improve internet accessibility for women.
