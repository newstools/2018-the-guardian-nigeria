Group buys Buhari expression of interest and nomination form at APC Secretariat, Abuja on Wednesday A group of ‘good Nigerians’ have bought President Muhammadu Buhari the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential nomination and expression of interest forms worth N45 million to re-contest his office in the party’s primary elections. The undisclosed group of Nigerians arrived the party’s secretariat in Abuja in company of APC chairman Adams Oshiomole to purchase the forms on behalf of president Buhari. While seeking election in 2015, Buhari claimed he was not buoyant to afford the presidential nomination form which cost N27.5 million, but a group of supporters bought it for him. Three years after, some of his supporters have purchased the form for him. “While President Buhari is far in China, a group of good Nigerians bought expression of interest form and nomination form for him.” Buhari media aide Bashir Ahmad tweeted. Earlier today, the APC announced it commenced sales of forms for all its elective offices, as well as a timetable for its primary elections. APC, at its recently concluded National Executive Council (NEC) adopted the use of direct primaries to elect candidates for next years general elections. The presidential primary is scheduled to hold on September 20 while governorship primaries will be conducted on September 25. The presidential nomination form is fixed at 40 million naira and expression of interest form at 5 million naira. Aspirants for state governorship will have to pay 22.5 million naira for nomination forms, and 2.5 million naira for expression of interest. In the same vein, those vying for the Senate, House of Representatives, and House of Assembly seats are to purchase the forms for N7m, N3.85m, and N850,000 respectively.
