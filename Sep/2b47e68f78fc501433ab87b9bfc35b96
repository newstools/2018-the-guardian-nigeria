 United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).  The AIFA Reading Society through its various programmes, has also contributed their quota towards enhancing the reading culture in Nigeria especially after observing the average student’s and young adult’s declining interest in reading and writing. The Society developed strategic schemes such as: the AIFA Book Drive, Calculate2Succeed, AIFA Reading Society Essay Competition, AIFA Book Club and iRead2Lead, among others to reduce the gap and shortcomings that exist in the quality of education available to different socio economic strata in the country on the principle that good education encourages reading. Through these projects over 5,000 lives have been impacted in Nigeria. The Society understands the importance of education for personal and collective development and as a tool for the reduction of poverty and improvement in the living standards of people living in Nigeria.  International Literacy Day is observed worldwide on September 8 and the theme for this year’s anniversary ‘Literacy and Skills Development,’ focusing on youth and adults within the lifelong learning framework. For International Literacy Day 2018, ‘skills’ means knowledge, skills and competencies required for employment, careers, and livelihoods, particularly technical and vocational skills, along with transferable skills  and digital skills. UNESCO notes that many young adults entering apprenticeships lack the basic literacy skills needed to succeed.
 
Bridging literacy and vocational skills gaps remains a major challenge faced by many especially young adults in Nigeria. The rate of unemployed youths has drastically increased in the last decade, largely as a result of fast-advancing digital technologies. This has brought major changes in the way people live, learn, work and interact and of course in the required skill set necessary for a person to thrive. Most young people from the university without having the needed skills or competencies that would enable them function in today’s emerging society. Hence digital literacy is essential when preparing pupils and students for the world of work as building and harnessing these skills will significantly influence their professional relevance and success. Nigeria aspires to become a major player in the world economy in line with her Vision 2020.  Vocational Education and Training is designed to educate youth and adults with the right skills needed in surviving in the ever changing labour market. The narrative of the basic academic education is gradually changing from basic paper credentials to skill-based qualifications which can be applied to specific skills required in the
workplace. Young people and adults venturing into apprenticeship also need the basic literacy skills to adapt and thrive in today’s emerging society.
 
It is clear from the foregoing that the state of Vocational Education in Nigeria calls for urgent attention. The Nigerian educational system requires urgent, innovative and practical reform to bring it in line with international best practices and importantly, better equip the young people of this country to handle the ever-expanding demands of the 21st century. Vocational education needs to be integrated into the school curriculum as this will equip students with the literacy and practical skills needed for lifelong learning. Government, educational administrators and policy makers are therefore called upon to invest massively and urgently in integrated approaches to developing the educational system as this will ultimately lead to building a better workforce and thus boosting the development of the Nigerian economy.
