Black Eyed Peas have through their music video for ‘Big Love’ tackled the sensitive issue of gun violence and immigration rocking the US. The song will be part of their new album, ‘Masters of the Sun’. The song is a reminder of their hit Where is the love released in 2003. The group announced that the proceeds from the song will be donated to the student-led ‘March for Our Lives’ organization, calling for stricter gun laws, and ‘Families Belong Together’, a protest against the Trump administration policy of separating children from families after they are detained crossing the U.S. border illegally. The new album will be released on 12 October 2018. This is their first album since the beginning released in 2010. See the video below.
