The SDP candidate, in Ile Ife, said that the decision to work with the APC was based on the condition he gave earlier for his support. Earlier on Monday, he had said: “My programme is payment of salaries and pensions. Good governance is what is important to me. Anyone between the two that will do that will get my support. I am passionate about Osun and my interest is the welfare of the people of this state. I have told those sent to me. At the appropriate time, we will tell you where we are going.” According to the SDP candidate, only the APC has accepted his conditions and that is why the SDP is going to form an alliance with the APC.
