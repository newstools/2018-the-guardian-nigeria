 FILE PHOTO: Nigerian Senate President Bukola Saraki arrives for a news conference at the National Assembly in Abuja, Aug. 8, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde/File Photo  Senate President Bukola Saraki has described the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed and other opponents in Kwara politics as transit politicians who visit the state once in four years.Speaking at the weekend in Minna as part of his presidential campaign to Niger State, Saraki stated that the people know their leaders and would not vote for wrong people. He said: “In Kwara, they are transit politicians. They only come around during elections.”He equally paid homage to one-time military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd). Reason for the visit was, though, hazy at press time. However, the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) of violence.  In a statement, the state publicity secretary, Tunde Ashaolu, recalled the alleged public disturbances involving supporters of the party in different locations within Ilorin, the capital city. In a quick reaction, the state chairman of the APC, Bashiru Bolarinwa Omolaja, dismissed the allegations as false and mischievous, adding that the ruling party must allegedly be stage-managing an attack system “in order to shift the blame to our people. They should look inward because we are peace-loving people. ” Besides, prominent lawyer, Muhammad Dele Belgore (SAN), is running for the office of the governor come next year.He told his supporters at the weekend in the capital that it was time for “Kwara to reclaim its rightful place as a first generation state.” The Ilorin-born senior lawyer hailed his supporters for “staying true to the ideals of good governance and community values” he represents.He is the sixth to have publicly declared intention to run for the position at next year’s polls.
