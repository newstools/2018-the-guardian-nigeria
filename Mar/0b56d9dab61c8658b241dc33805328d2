There are a few things more beautiful than lush lips. Here are a few tips on how to achieve the lush lips: Exfoliate: We can’t stress this enough. Exfoliation removes dead and chapped lips to make your lips smooth. There are several ways of exfoliating; however, a DIY (Do-It-yourself) way of doing this is to use one teaspoon of honey and two teaspoons of sugar and scrub. Do this at least three times a week and thank both later. You can also moisturise the night before by using a lip balm. Apply a tiny bit of foundation on your finger and blend evenly on your lips. Add sheer powder to make it matte. You should always be guided when using a lip pencil. The lip pencil should be the same colour as your lipstick. Trace the lip pencil on your lip line leaving only the middle of the lower lip. Now apply the lipstick. And blend. By now, you should have the full matte effect. Apply lip gloss to finish the look.
