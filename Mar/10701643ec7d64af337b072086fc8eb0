Specifically, the Chief Operating Officer of the firm, Ambrose Omodion said: “We expect a reversal on the strength of low prices and more earnings reports to hit the market, with economic indices remaining strongly positive for bargain hunters to take advantage of this pullback to position for short trading. “Even as more income investors take position in value and dividend paying stocks, ahead of 2018 Q1 corporate earnings and economic data, we also expect volatility and repositioning to continue, while profit taking will reduce on the strength of expected payout and earnings’ surprises.
 
“However, we would like to reiterate that investors should not panic, but go for equities with intrinsic value, especially during this season when dividend payment is approaching. “We advise investors to allow numbers guide their decisions, while repositioning for the rest of the year’s trading activities, especially now that stock prices remain volatile amid improving company, economic and market fundamentals.”
