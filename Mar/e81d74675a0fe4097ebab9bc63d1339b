IDPs. PHOTO: GETTYOMAGES The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately recover over N28 billion meant for the rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the northeast but allegedly stolen by members of the cabal and certain interests in the All Progressives Congress (APC). The party said the presidency and the APC are not being sincere with the IDPs just as it alleged that it was  providing cover for those who have been frittering away billions of naira donated for the well being of victims of insurgency. The PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, said the president cannot in all honesty claim not to be aware of reported sharp practices, involving billions of naira in the management of funds in the presidential initiative on the North East, since the issues came into the public domain. “Indeed, the Presidency cannot, in any way imaginable, claim not to be aware of reports that sometime in August 2017, a cabinet minister and a high ranking presidency official were alleged to have diverted N18 billion from the N48 billion approved by the National Assembly for the rehabilitation of millions of IDPs and rebuilding of six northeast states ravaged by insurgency in the 2017 budget,” the party said. The PDP went further to state that “The APC and the Buhari Presidency cannot claim to be unaware of the damning report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), a public document which detailed how officials were using bulk of the resources meant for the IDPs on contracts that were found to have immensely benefitted officials of the APC Government including the sacked Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal.” Read More: CAN donates relief materials to IDPs in Nasarawa state According to the opposition party, “The Buhari Presidency and the APC cannot also claim to be unaware of the motion by Senator Baba Kaka Garba from Borno Central, who exposed how persons known to have connections with the APC, fraudulently cornered N1.2 billion from the Federal Government under the guise of supplying items to IDPs.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
