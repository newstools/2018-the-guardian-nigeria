Feminism has always been a sensitive topic. When you ask someone why they feel that everyone is not equal, they may talk about how they were not created the same and mention the roles accorded to different genders. By whom? “We spend too much time teaching girls to worry about what boys think of them. But the reverse is not the case,” award-winning Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says in We Should All Be Feminists, which has become one of the world’s most popular pro-gender parity manifestos. Our culture has a selective use of gender as a reason for social norms. We use biology to explain the privileges men have, mostly referencing their physical superiority.At some point in time, perhaps when these gender roles were formed, physical strength was necessary for survival and the strongest person ruled. Men are, as a matter of fact, physically stronger than women–this doesn’t minimise the fact that there are a lot of exceptional people who don’t conform to this statement–and, perhaps because of this, are more often than not put in leadership positions.
