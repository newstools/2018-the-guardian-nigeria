 Candidates of the last Joint Administration and Matriculation Board examination protesting their inability to write the examination in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital…yesterday  The students claimed they were split into two batches at Stella Maris Center in Ohaukwu local government area of the state since the hall and available computers could not accommodate all of them but after the first batch, there was no time to conduct exams for the second. The protesters also included other candidates who alleged what they described as “mysterious” disappearance of their results on the Board’s website after it had been released. Carrying placards with various inscriptions, one of the candidates who identified herself as Okorie Felicia noted that the officials told them to wait that their exams would be rescheduled since there was no space or computers to accommodate them but till date, are yet to write the exam. Another candidate, Ugwu Peter said he checked his result and scored 274 but on going to print the result, no mark was found. Meanwhile, the coordinator of NNA Academy called on JAMB to revert to the paper exams, adding that lack of exam materials at various centers have culminated to the inefficiencies in the conduct of the examination, asking the Board to reschedule the exams for the affected students and also expedite actions toward the prompt release of the remaining results.
