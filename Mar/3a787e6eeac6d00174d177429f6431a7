 golf  The entire club, with close to 2,000 members, was just rising from its 96th Annual General Meeting, which returned Colonel Ibrahim Biu, as Captain when curtains were drawn from a huge plaque.

Eyes closed, face serene, calm and guarded, the big man, who sits atop Pinnacle Communications, was already blinking back tears of joy. But in truth, the whole moment counted for such joy, and tears of joy. The huge effort started sometime last year when the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasri El-Rufai hosted investors in Kaduna.
