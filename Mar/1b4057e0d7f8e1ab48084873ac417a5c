26-year old self acclaimed fortune teller, Babatunde Samuel has been arrested and charged before a Lagos Magistrate court for defrauding a woman to the tune of N500, 000 after engaging her in a purported sex deliverance that lasted for one month in Lagos. The incident happened at Jofolo Street in Iyana Ipaja area of Abule-Oke where the fortuneteller allegedly took the victim for the sex deliverance. Ondo State-born Samuel, who informed the police that he was a film trader before becoming a fortuneteller, gave the victim a false prophecy that triggered fear in her. According to the victim, Samuel informed her she would die soon and needed deliverance to cast out the spirit of death. It was gathered that Samuel told the victim things about her and her family and she asked for the solution to avert the calamities. She narrated that Samuel told her to pay N500, 000, buy a goat and engage in sexual intercourse with him for a month.
