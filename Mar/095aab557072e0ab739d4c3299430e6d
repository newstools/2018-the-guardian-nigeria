This is despite an earlier rebuttal by Col. Tukur Gusau, spokesperson for the Minister of Defence, Gen. Mansur Dan-Ali. Contrary to claims by the Army that it did not report cases of attacks and impending attacks by heavily armed Fulani militia to its high command, officials of the state government showed several letters to The Guardian, specifically alerting the federal government and military authorities of impending attacks. According to Bala Dan Abu, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Darius Ishaku: “We have lost confidence in the federal government’s security forces to protect citizens in Taraba State.” Abu claimed that a strange chopper was sited dropping arms and ammunitions for use by the militia groups and this was promptly reported, but nothing was done to avert the attacks and killings that followed. He reiterated the state government’s demand for the immediate redeployment of Lt-Col. Ibrahim Babatunde Gambari, Commanding Officer of 93 Battalion Ada Barracks in Takum, for allegedly leading his troops to attack and destroy properties of innocent Taraba citizens.
