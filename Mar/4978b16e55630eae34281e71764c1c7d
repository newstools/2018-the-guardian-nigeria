 Mercy Johnson Mr Chef brand ambassador  This synergy, according to the firm, was necessitated by the drive to retain and increase patronage with the introduction of rebranded sachet packs and friendly packaging containers, which prevent moisture penetration and retain freshness at the point of retail sales. Chairman, Royal Salt, Chief Reggie Uduhiri, said the development was crucial to reposition the brand as the number one salt in Nigeria, noting that Mr Chef Salt is fortified with iodine and has this uniqueness that cares not only about promoting the product quality, but also to enhance healthy living among Nigerians. Speaking on the endorsement of Mercy Johnson as the brand ambassador, he added that she is the ideal personality that encapsulates what Mr. Chef Brand stands for today. “She is a good homemaker, mother and wife and a prolific actress that appeals to almost every Nigerian. These attributes place her in the best position to tell her Mr. Chef story, which is beyond adding taste to life,” he stated. Non-Executive Director, Royal Salt, Alhaji Lawal Idirisu, noted that the deal would help reduce iodine deficiency in Nigerians, as research shows that iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and it is a leading preventable cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities and thyroid gland problem (endemic goitre). Idirisu said the firm reached an agreement because of her story, values, and appealing personality, which is what they needed.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
