Naming public monuments after respectable members of the society is not a novel development as such practice predates civilisations. Varying reasons are often responsible for such monumental honours, but of fundamental value is the good deeds of such persons to the society. Since the advent of financial crisis in Osun State in 2013, Governor Rauf Aregbesola, has developed greater respect for workers in the state.The mutual relationship between Aregbesola and the workers peaked on March 6, 2018 with the naming of a major road as “Workers Drive,” in honour of the workers.In his speech at the commissioning of the road, a 2.8km dual carriageway Aregbesola said, “We have decided to name the road after our workers in the state because of their loyalty, commitment and perseverance in the quest to achieve this. I salute the workers for all their commitment; our workers have been cutting edge instruments to the realisation of our goals to our people.” He maintained that civil servants had shown a high level of understanding and cooperation with the government, especially when the state was in serious financial distress.He also applauded The Apostolic Church, which one of its magnificient church buildings had to give way for the construction of the triangular junction and reconstruction of the road, saying like the church, 170 people, with 579 structures, including residential houses, shops, uncompleted buildings, churches, mosques etc also suffered similar fate. Even after the property owners were compensated with money amounting to N392m, Aregbesola did not fail to acknowledge their sacrifices in letting go of their structures for the development of Osogbo, the state capital.He maintained that the demolition would not have taken place had owners of the structures strictly followed town planning rules and regulations, adding that “it is significant to say here that there was never this type of cooperation in the past in a bid to have this same road made into a good one that will integrate the old Osogbo Town with the new one for the purpose of socio-economic development.” Aregbesola revealed that the funds used for the construction of the road was sourced from the Omoluabi Infrastructure Conservation Fund, contrary to claims by some that the road rehabilitation was sponsored by UNESCO. The Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Dr. Najeem Salam, confirmed that the House gave the necessary approvals for the governor to access money from the Omoluabi Infrastructure Conservation Fund for the purpose of reconstructing the Orita-Olaiya-Odiolowo-Isale-Osun-Ita Olokan Road. Salam said that the state assembly was proud of the performance of the Aregbesola administration, as well as being happy to be associated with the road’s facelift.The first President of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Hassan Sunmonu, a prominent indigene of Osogbo, led the workers team, which included state leaders of NLC, Trade Union Congress (TUC), Nigeria Union of Local Government Employee, and the Joint Negotiation Council. Sunmonu in his remarks expressed gratitude to the governor for his strides, saying as a member of the labour movement, it was surprising that he could expend so much effort at making workers happy. The state NLC Chairman, Comrade Jacob Adekomi, who spoke on behalf of all the labour unions, commended Aregbesola for his sensitivity to the plight of the workers, acknowledging that his administration has been workers’ friendly.  Adekomi stated that workers in the state were happy and delighted at the commissioning of the road at a time when many governments were complaining of lack of funds.
