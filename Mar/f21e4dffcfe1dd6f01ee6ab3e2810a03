Whole grains are cereals or pseudocereal that contains the endosperm, germ, and bran. Examples of whole grains include whole wheat and whole wheat derivates, oats, brown rice, barley, corn, quinoa, rye, buckwheat, and millet. These foods might seem ordinary but they have a lasting effect on the body if consumed regularly. Here are some of those benefits. Bread And Grains Photo credit_ The Health Orange Fibre Fibre is a major reason to add whole grains to your everyday diet. Whole grains typically contain two types of fibre—soluble and insoluble—which are both food for the health. Adults need roughly 23 to 35 grams of fibre daily and mixing up wholegrains ranging from brown rice to wheat bread at different meal times can help achieve that. Fibre helps the body stay full longer and helps control blood sugar.  Digestion A lot of the benefits of whole grain foods rest on their high fibre content. Fibre helps keep bowel movements regular and help fight diverticulosis—a condition that occurs when pouches form on the colon wall causing inflammation, constipation and diarrhoea. Apart from fibre, whole grains are also rich in lactic acid which promotes good bacteria in the large intestine.  Lower Cholesterol Levels Whole grains stop the body from absorbing bad cholesterol and help lower triglycerides, both of which are serious contributors to heart disease. A study found that women who ate 2-3 servings of whole grain products daily were 30% less likely to have a heart attack or die from any related heart disease compared with women who didn’t.  Lower Blood Pressure The benefits of the heart from whole grains go beyond cholesterol and triglycerides. They also help lower blood pressure and insulin levels—which are two of the most crucial risk factors for heart disease. A study showed that men who ate more than 7 servings of a whole grain breakfast cereal in a week had a 19% lower risk of suffering hypertension.
