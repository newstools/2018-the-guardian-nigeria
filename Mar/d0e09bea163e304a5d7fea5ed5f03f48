It stated that, “among some of the issues young Nigerian lawyers grapple with are low Remuneration, unbearable work environments, unemployment, lack of opportunities for growth and promotion, as well as lack of healthy Work/Life balance.
  
“While this crippling status quo remains, the market welcomes not less than 3,000 new wigs every year. Only a lucky few will land a spot with the limited number of thriving workplaces scattered across Nigeria.
  
The firm therefore stated that willing participants would have a One-on-One basis and get an opportunity to share from a resourceful wealth of experience as a successful lawyer-preneur. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
