Stephanie Anani is currently in her second year of studying Civil Engineering at the Scottish University. When she isn’t busy studying, she is helping other students in their pursuit of higher education by working as an International Student Ambassador. As part of her role, she speaks to lots of International students and has compiled a list of frequently asked questions. One of the questions she gets asked the most is ‘What’s the weather like in Dundee?’. She replies that before she came to Scotland she thought it would always be raining, but when she arrived she was pleasantly surprised. It never got as cold as she thought it would. She tells Nigerian applicants not to worry about the weather. She also tells them that her flat is a 5-minute walk to most of her classes and a 10-minute walk to the city centre. She laughs as she says that she has never had to take a bus since arriving in Dundee. When asked ‘Can I get food from back home?’ Stephanie replies that you can get Nigerian food in Dundee and you can also order it online. On asking about her aspirations, Stephanie replies ‘I want to achieve a number of things in my lifetime, but the common thread between all my aspirations is the desire to help people have more enjoyable lives.’ With scholarships of up to £5,000 for international students and a cost of living that is 14% lower than the UK average, the University of Dundee is a great choice for undergraduate and postgraduate students. The University of Dundee has been ranked in the world’s top 200 Universities and one of only 12 in the United Kingdom to also hold a Gold Award in the Teaching Excellence Framework 2017. Dundee offers degrees in Law, Business, Management, Computing, Energy, Engineering, Politics, Nursing, Public Health and more.
