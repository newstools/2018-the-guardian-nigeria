According to experts, who gathered in Lagos, at a cyber security forum, hackers have exploited and keep exploiting compromised credentials of people and businesses. Regional Manager, Sub-Saharan Africa, Forcepoint, Christo Van Staden, speaking on “The Modern Challenge of Securing an increasing Digitalized World of Corporate ICT,” noted that the paradigm change of security is due to the current complications. ‘‘In the past, it is used to be that all you had to worry about was your corporate network, but today, a lot of your data is stored in multiple cloud providers, whether it’s Salesforce, or Box, or Amazon, so we at Forcepoint challenged ourselves to rethink cybersecurity, as we are purpose built by Raytheon to provide a next generation cybersecurity solution,”he said. According to him, other challenges faced by customers include; lack of visibility and understanding of how the data was being accessed. “What they’re telling is that their data is now stored everywhere in multiple clouds, and they have no visibility to know where it is, plus you have an interconnected network of suppliers and customers, all of whom rely on data from you, and who store data that you have provided. All of these customers, supply chain vendors are entry points into your network. “So your world is much more complicated. What we hear from customers in this world is that they don’t have visibility of their data, they do not know where to store, they do not know who is accessing it because a supplier could be accessing it, a remote employee could be accessing it. It’s just much more difficult to figure out how to have visibility and access when data is stored in the cloud for example. “They also are not sure exactly who is accessing their data. It could be a supplier, it could be a remote employee who is traveling, could be a customer. So this lack of visibility and understanding of how the data is being accessed is a headache for them.” Furthermore, he stated that another issue was a disjointed security policy, adding: “there are too many point solutions to address some of these problems with a disjointed security policy that makes it even harder to control them. Many of our customers tell us that they are drowning in alerts. “In fact, half of the managers say that they see over 5,000 alerts a day, but they are not able to tell what is a real problem and what is merely a minor problem. There are so many signals that they’ve just become noise. And worst of all, by the time they figure out what’s going on, it’s often too late. The data has already left the company’s store systems. In fact, it takes an average 46 days after an attack to be completed.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
