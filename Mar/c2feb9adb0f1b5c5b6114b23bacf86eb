 President Buhari<br />Photo TWITTER/NGRPresident  Ikubese said this yesterday at a press conference held in the NUJ Press Centre, Akure, faulting the positions put forward by the Federal Government on the account of scarce fund and duplicity of duties. Moreover, he urged the National Assembly to recall the bill and muster two-thirds majority in spite of President Buhari’s veto power, warning, “a country that fails to engage its youths productively is a nation sitting on a keg of gunpowder.” According to him, the refusal by the President dashed the hopes of about 150,000 young unemployed Nigerians, prompting one Gambo Timothy Dogo in Gombe State to commit suicide after the president declined the bill last Tuesday. He affirmed that there is acute shortage of police in the nation as only 370,000 police watch over the security of about 186million Nigerian populace, lamenting that it is far below best global practices. Ikubese argued that a staggering 80 per cent of the 370,000 police available are assigned for private duties while only 20 per cent are saddled with overbearing responsibilities of core policing in the society.
