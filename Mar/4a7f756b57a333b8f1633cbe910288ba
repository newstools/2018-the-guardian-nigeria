Barcelona have reached agreement with Brazilian club Gremio to sign Arthur, a 21-year old midfielder. The Spanish club said in a statement on Sunday that they can activate an option to sign Arthur in July by paying a basic 30 million euros ($36.9mn) plus 9mn in add ons. Earlier Spanish media reports had suggested Arthur would join next winter, after the South American campaign. The deal follows a sustained courtship Arthur helped propel Gremio to the final of the Copa Libertadores last year and was impressive as they beat Lanus of Argentina, 3-1, on aggregate in the final. He did not finish the second leg, limping off in the second half with a torn ankle ligament. The injury meant Arthur missed the Club World Cup in December. He will join compatriots Coutinho and Paulinho in the Barcelona midfield. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
