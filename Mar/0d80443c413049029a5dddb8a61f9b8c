 Rev. Yakubu Pam  It specifically decried the killings in Irigwe Chiefdom of Bassa and Daffo districts in Bokkos Local Council of the state by those he described as enemies of the peace-loving people of Plateau. Pam in a strongly worded statement in Jos yesterday, said all those who love and cherish peace on the Plateau should condemn the ugly development in recent times. According to him, the government and security agencies should ensure that those behind the current attacks and killings of innocent people of the state are brought to justice. He wondered why some people were after the peace of the state and are doing all they could to plunge the state to another era of bloodbath in the past during which the people of Plateau did not know peace as a result of activities of crisis merchants. Pam commended the decision of Governor Simon Lalong to impose a dusk-to -dawn curfew on Bassa Local Council in an effort to create room for security agents to carry out their assignment in the communities.
