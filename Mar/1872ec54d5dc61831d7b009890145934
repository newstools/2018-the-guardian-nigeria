Most times, finding the size of files on a Mac can be a real hassle. Here are some tips that can help with this task. To begin with, it’s best to switch to list view because it provides the most information—including file size. If the size column is not visible in the Finder window, add it by control-clicking on the headers that are visible — Kind, Date Last Opened and others — and clicking Size. After that, click on the Size header to order the list by size. This is an important tip for people who want to free up space on their Mac. Sometimes when you click the size header to sort size, the mac doesn’t show all the files in that folder—particularly the Recents folder. To fix this, click the gear icon at the top of the window and select Arrange By…Size. The files will be sorted into different sections by file size in descending order. For any file or folder, you can quickly the size by control-clicking it and selecting Get Info. On the top right corner of the Get Info panel, the size should appear.
