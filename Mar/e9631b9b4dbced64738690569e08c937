 Tunde Fowler  In commending the revenue process, he said it has ensured the judicious spending of taxpayers’ money in building infrastructure and socio-security programmes. Fowler’s visit was part of activities marking the 140th Quarterly Meeting of the Joint Tax Board, being hosted in Osogbo, by the Osun State Board of Internal Revenue Service. The chairman explained that the Aregbeola’s government has been resilient, dogged and focused at raising the bar of good governance in all ramifications. He added that this was achieved, despite the present economic realities in the country.

According to him, the governor has demonstrated a high sense of commitment to human and capital development, which, he said was achieved through innovative ideology on robust taxation. He explained that Osun State has made giant strides to stimulate its economy with determined efforts to an improved revenue generation. He urged other states to key into the state’s revenue generation policy, which has witnessed a geometric improvement in the last few years. He said: “What Aregbesola has done in increasing tax revenue in Osun is amazing. While the Federal Inland Revenue Service is advocating at least 25 per cent increment from states, it is worthy of note that Aregbesola has increased the state’s tax revenue. “Osun was not like this before the advent of this administration, and I know that the state doesn’t get much from the federal allocations.” In his response, Aregbesola implored the people to imbibe the spirit of tax payment, stressing that no meaningful development could take place without the assistance of the people. He called on the various governments in the country to mobilise their people to pay tax to support societal growth.
