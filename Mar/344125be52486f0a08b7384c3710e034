Nevertheless, a trip to Wembley in the semi-finals could provide a welcome tonic as the new manager tries to make his presence felt. It was essential Southampton avoided following in the footsteps of Manchester City, West Ham and Bournemouth — top-flight sides who had all perished against third tier giant-killers Wigan in the FA Cup this season. They achieved that aim thanks to second half goals from Pierre Emile Hojbjerg and Cedric Soares. Southampton joined Tottenham and Manchester United in the semi-finals, with Leicester and Chelsea meeting in the last quarter-final later on Sunday. After a scrappy first half, Southampton took the lead in the 62nd minute. Dusan Tadic’s corner was stabbed goalwards by Hojbjerg and Wigan’s Dan Burn couldn’t react quick enough to clear off the line. Manolo Gabbiadini had a chance to double Southampton’s advantage in the 73rd minute when he got past Burn and the Wigan centre-back brought him down in the penalty area. But Wigan goalkeeper Christian Walton plunged to his left and pushed Gabbiadini’s powerful spot-kick round the post. Wigan applied plenty of pressure in the closing stages, but couldn’t emulate their epic fifth round success against Premier League leaders City. In the first minute of stoppage-time, Southampton right back Soares surged into the area before side-footing past Walton.
