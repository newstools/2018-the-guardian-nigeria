 Yahaya Bello  The Senate directed its committee on INEC to immediately conduct the investigation and submit its report for consideration within two weeks.Adopting a motion sponsored by Senator Mohammed Hassan (PDP, Yobe State), the Senate noted that the investigation would help in sanitising the electoral system. President of the Senate, Abubakar Bukola Saraki, in a remark on the matter said: “This issue is important because the stability of our democracy depends on the credibility of our electoral processes. “And as such, we must ensure that the processes are always what we can be proud of, especially now that countries all over are looking up to our electoral processes.“I am happy that the INEC chairman is seated here. It is something that he could look into and come back to tell us where the issue is.” Defending the motion earlier, Senator Hassan said: “It was reported recently in the newspapers that the Governor of Kogi State was involved in double registration in the voter registration exercise. “Again, some days or weeks after, INEC held a press conference in which it confirmed sacking three of its workers.The newspapers reported that Bllo had been issued another voter card from another ward. We are concerned about this and I think it is very important that the Senate Committee on INEC investigates and get to the root of this matter. Hassan added that it was reported everywhere that Bello claimed that he couldn’t be prosecuted because he has immunity.He stressed that for the purpose of getting this picture very right; the Senate Committee on INEC should investigate and get the matter right.The electoral commission had last December dismissed two of its officials for their alleged roles in the electoral scandal.
