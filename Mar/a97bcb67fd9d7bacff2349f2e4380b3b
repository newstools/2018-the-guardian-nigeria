Rugby • Racing retains 2018 10s trophy 
As part of efforts to develop women rugby in the country, the Nigerian Rugby Football Federation (NRFF) has taken steps to revive the women’s league through the 10s championship. Last weekend at the British International School, Oniru, Lekki Lagos, a women’s team from Abia State engaged their Lagos State counterparts in an exciting two-part match that attracted rugby connoisseurs from across the country. At the event also was a ‘Tag Rugby’ version of the schools tournament in which Avi-Cena Junior School defeated their hosts, British International School Juniors by two Tries (10 points) to One Try (five points). After the setback, BIS came back strong to defeat Ojoku High School 10-0 in the Seniors Schools Cup Contact version event. In the   Men’s 10s event, Cowrie Rfc defeated hosts, Racing Rfc 26-0 in the final to kick start their 2018 season on a winning note. Both teams were unbeaten all day until the final match. Cowries started on the front foot and led 5-0 in the second minute when fly half, Azeez Ladipo broke the Racing defence and released Captain Ono Jatto, who raced 35 meters for their first try.
