 Governor Ishaku  The crisis, which began around 3:00p.m. last Thursday at Yerimaru village of Kakara town in Sardauna council area, has refused to abate. Instead, it had spread to several communities in the area, leaving in its wake deaths in their numbers as well as displacement of families who have now taken refuge in neighbouring local councils and killing of cattle. The fight resurrected yesterday in Yelwa, Tunga Adamu and Maisamari villages where reporters were trapped for over three hours. The attacks resulted in the burning down of hundreds of houses as well as massive destruction of farmlands. The Guardian saw many residents fleeing the council for the nearby Gashaka local government area. The genesis of the renewed feud, it was learnt, has its root in a court ruling on a piece of land which the other party refuses to take in good faith. Security chiefs have, however, relocated to the area. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misel, said the command was leaving no stone unturned to halt the spread of the crisis. The spokesman, who also confirmed rescuing trapped persons, said: “We also succeeded in arresting those who set one of the villages ablaze.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
