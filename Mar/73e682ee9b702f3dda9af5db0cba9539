The importance of eating healthy foods cannot be overemphasized. The heart is one of the most important organs in the body and it needs to be given special attention at all times. Here are some food items that can give your heart a healthy boost. Tomatoes are rich in potassium and lycopene– an antioxidant which is responsible for the red pigmentation of the fruit. Studies have shown that these two components have a positive effect on blood pressure and an overall benefit for the heart. Olive oil is highly rated as one of the most heart-healthy cooking oils. This is because almost all the fat content in olive oil comes from monounsaturated fats which help increase the amount good cholesterol in the body while reducing the harmful ones. These harmful cholesterol play a major role in the most heart related diseases that exist today. Walnuts are known to be a great source of plant-based omega 3 fatty acid, proteins, fibre and alpha-linolenic acid. These component help reduce risk factors for heart disease, including high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Not all sources of animal protein or fat are harmful to the body. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are lean proteins and are a great animal protein option. They are high in protein but lower in cholesterol and saturated fat than red meats– beef or lamb– which make them safe for consumption.
