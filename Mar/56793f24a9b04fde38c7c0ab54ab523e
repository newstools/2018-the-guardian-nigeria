 NCC Building  While broadband penetration fluctuates between 21 and 22 per cent, the commission said the spectrum would address the growing demands by operators for data centric, high speed and high capacity links for metropolitan environment.It would also assist the commission to drive the national wireless access (NWA) initiative in the country.
   
The NCC expressed commitment that the release of the frequency spectrum, also known as V-Band, would make it possible for it to achieve 30 per cent broadband penetration by the end of 2018.He stressed that some forms of control are still needed to ensure that standards and guidelines are complied with.
   
Earlier at a consultative forum on the process yesterday, the NCC Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Dambatta, explained the importance of the radio frequency spectrum.
He said it is the fundamental resource for the provision of wireless communication services, leading to the opening of the 60Ghz band. It is also useful for the presentation of draft regulatory framework for amateur radio services in the country. Represented by the Director, Research and Development at the commission, Abigail Solanke, he said the forum was organised in line with the NCC’s eight-point agenda.He added that it is also a traditionally institutionalised policy to ensure participatory regulation, by conducting industry-wide consultation with all relevant industry stakeholders.
