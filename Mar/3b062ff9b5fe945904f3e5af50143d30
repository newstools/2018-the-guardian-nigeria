 Muazu Babangida Aliyu  Aliyu is standing trial alongside the State PDP Chairman, Tanko Beji and a former Commissioner of Environment, Umar Nasko, over alleged N4.568billion fraud and abuse of office. At the resumed hearing of the matter, Sam Adda, counsel to Nasko, prayed the court to adjourn the matter sine die (indefinitely). According to the counsel, the call for adjournment is due to an appeal filed against the court’s decision to dismiss his preliminary objection, challenging the court’s jurisdiction to try his client. Adda said that he had applied to the Court of Appeal for an order staying the proceedings of the trial at the state high court pending the determination of his appeal. He maintained that continuing proceedings at the state high court while there was an application for stay of proceedings before a superior court would amount to judicial rascality. The EFCC counsel, Chile Okoroma, however, objected to the application to adjourn the matter indefinitely. He argued that stay of proceedings should not be granted in cases prosecuted by the anti-grant agency. He urged the court to dismiss the application as he was ready to call his witnesses who were in court for commencement of trial. In his ruling, Justice Aliyu Mayaki said it was important to wait for the ruling of the Court of Appeal as regards the application for stay of proceedings.
