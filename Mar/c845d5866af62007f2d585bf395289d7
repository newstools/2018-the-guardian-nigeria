Samsung’s latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S9, is out. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus have all the bells and whistles you’d expect from the newest flagship from one of the world’s top smartphone makers. They have the same excellent OLED edge-to-edge Infinity Display that Samsung introduced with the S8 (5.8 inches on the S9 and 6.2 inches on the S9 Plus), the latest Snapdragon 845 processor, and a far more sensibly placed fingerprint sensor. This year, there are some hardware differences between the larger and smaller devices. For example, the S9 Plus, in addition to a bigger screen and battery, also has 6GB of RAM (over the S9’s 4GB), and a dual-camera system for zooming and portrait mode effects, similar to the Note 8 from last year.
