The Lagos state government and ministry of Agriculture this week held a one-day HIV/AIDS Prevention and sensitization workshop for all abattoir stakeholders in the state. The workshop, which took place at the Oko Oba Farm service centre, Agege, Lagos, had in attendance butchers, meat sellers, transporters and other stakeholders in the meat distribution chain in the state. Speaking at the workshop, Titilayo Abraham Onu, Program manager for HIV Prevention unit, urged all stakeholders to maintain good health and prevent spread of diseases. She noted that the safety of stakeholders must come first before the distribution of meat to the public. Also speaking at the workshop, Sola Faboyode, Chief Agric officer and Project management team unveiled a facilitator who said he has been committed to the project after he tested positive to HIV. Alabede Mojeeb, Secretary of Unity Motors, applauded the team and urged individuals to engage in proper health counseling on how to manage oneâ€™s status at its early stages.A free HIV counseling session/test desk was provided for participants who wanted to check their status or just receive counsel from trained staff.
