Lagos witnessed an incredible moment at the Lagos International Polo Tournament held at the Lagos Polo Club two weeks ago. The tournament which was a partnership of the trendy champagne, Veuve Clicquot and Lagos Polo Club, created an exceptional space combining polo games, fashion, fun and champagne. Guests invited to the lounge enjoyed chilled flutes of Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label and Veuve Clicquot Rich, as well as sweets from Harrods and nibbles from the Chef Fregz. Some of the guests in attendance were Eku Edewor, OC Ukeje, Udoka Oyeka, Ozzy Agu, Mimi Onalaja, Noble Igwe, DJ Obi, Veronika Odeka among others. See exclusive pictures of the event below:
