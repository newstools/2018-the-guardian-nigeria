Equity transactions on the stock market closed on a downturn yesterday, following price losses suffered by major highly capitalised stocks, especially Dangote Cement, and Total, as investors’ wealth depreciated significantly by 1.53 per cent. Yesterday, the All-share index, which measures the performance of listed firms dropped by 657.07 points 1.51 per cent, the biggest loss in the month so far to 42,952.70 points, from 43,609.77 recorded on Tuesday. Similarly, market capitalisation of listed equities declined by N236billion or 1.53 per cent from N15.666trillion to N15.430trillion.The drop in indices may, however, be attributed to profit taking by investors to recoup the investment from price appreciation of the previous week.Precisely, analysts from Codros Capital, said: “The drop is due to investors booking profit on previous gains in major stocks. Despite loss in today’s session, we believe legroom for gains still exist; more so, as investors position ahead of Q4 2017 corporate earnings releases.” About 23 stocks constituted the losers chart at the end of yesterday’s trading.
