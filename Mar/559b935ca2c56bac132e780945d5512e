The quantity and quality of water that is available for human consumption today has been affected by damaged ecosystems. Now, 2.1 billion people live without safe drinking water at home; it affects their health, education and general livelihood. Due to this knowledge, the UN member states and agencies and various other NGOs have become involved in the promotion of clean water conservation and has helped focus the attention of people on all the critical issues of water. They also promote the supply of clean and purified water.
