Seven people have been reported killed from the outbreak of Cerebrospinal Meningitis in Katsina State. The deaths were said to have occurred at Ganga and Jaje villages, in Jibia Local Council Area of the state. The Guardian leant that the incident is coming on the heels of the deaths of seven students of the Federal University, Dutsinma. Conflicting reports said the students died of cholera-related illness, or meningitis, due to overcrowded hostels. But the school authorities have however denied that the students died of meningitis, adding that there was no overcrowding at the hostels. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Dr. Kabir Mustapha, confirmed the outbreak of the disease in Jibia. He, however, said the state government had mobilised resources and men to the affected communities. Mustapha explained that government swung into action immediately by deploying men and resources in the area. Some people have blamed the Jibia deaths on extreme change of weather across the state. These incidents are in addition to the more than 100 cases of whopping cough in three villages that include Dambawa, Anguwan Kuka, and Kashemu in the area. Meanwhile, the striking doctors in Kogi State have threatened to shut down all healthcare centres in the state. The Chairman of the state chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Dr. Tijani Godwin, and Secretary, Dr. Zubair Kabiru, disclosed this in a communiqué. The doctors, who have been on strike since January 7, are seeking the balance of 40 per cent salary arrears, as well as the implementation of revised CONMESS. The doctors said the shutdown would include privately owed facilities, if the state government fails to address their demands. The statement warned the government not to take their magnanimity for weakness, since they allowed its members to offer skeletal services despite the ongoing strike. It condemned the government’s decision to compulsorily retired experienced medical officers. The association directed all health care centres in the state to remain shut, and urged its members at the Federal Medical Centers, Lokoja to go on sympathy strike every three days of the month.
