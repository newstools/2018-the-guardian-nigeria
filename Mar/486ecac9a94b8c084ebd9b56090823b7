This initiative is part of Cisco’s strategic partnership with the Federal Ministry of Education to provide access to quality ICT education in the Country. The project is driven by one of Cisco’s Networking Academy Support Centres, UNITeS, and so far, two IoT Innovation Centres have already been established at the Federal Science and Technical College, Yaba and at FGC, Bwari, Abuja.
