Analysts at Afrinvest Securities Limited attributed the drop in indices to profit taking and contagion effect of the rout in equities across global markets. According to them, investors are currently taking profit in stocks that had rallied significantly before the beginning of the earnings season. “The sell offs experienced in the local bourse so far can largely be attributed to profit taking in stocks that had rallied significantly before the beginning of the earnings season as well as contagion effect of the rout in equities across global markets. “With investors sceptical of forward earnings vis-à-vis elevated valuations, sentiment has turned bearish in recent trading sessions. We believe declining level of valuation has presented investors with attractive entry opportunity; hence, we expect a reversal of the bearish trend in the near term.” AFRINSURE dominated in volume terms with 82 million shares worth N20.4 million while Japaul oil followed with 75 million valued at N42 million. Fidelity bank accounted fot 63 million shares worth N151 million. Zenith bank accounted for 29 million shares worth N837 million. FBN Holdings exchanged 28 million shares worth N344 million.
