 Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, Governor State of Osun.  The governor also named a triangular junction at the starting point of the former Olaiya-Odi-Olowo-Ita-Olookan road after the Apostolic Church. The church had been demolished to pave way for the construction of the triangular junction and reconstruction of the road. He said the fund for the road was sourced from the Omoluabi Infrastructure Conservative Fund, adding that he named the former Olaiya-Odi-Olowo-Ita-Olookan road after the workers to appreciate their steadfastness, sacrifice and loyalty during the financial crisis in the state. Aregbesola disclosed that 579 structures consisting of houses, shops, uncompleted building, mosques, churches and others were standing on the road before the reconstruction, adding that 170 people were compensated with N392 million for the separation of their structures from road. Sympathizing with the property owners that were separated from the road in the cause of the project, the governor said it was the intention of his administration to make Osogbo a true state capital that will attract investors. Speaking on behalf of other royal fathers at the event, the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, described Aregbesola’s administration as impactful and very beneficial to the people of the state. Commenting, the labour unions in the state, led by the chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Jacob Adekomi, commended Aregbesola for his sensitivity to the plight of workers, acknowledging that his administration has been workers’ friendly.
