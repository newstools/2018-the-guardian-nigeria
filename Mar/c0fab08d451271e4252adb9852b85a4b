Luca Guadagnino, the director of Call Me by Your Name, has said that he is “already conceiving” a sequel to 2017’s coming-of-age movie. He shared the news on the Oscars red carpet, telling USA Today that he and author André Aciman, who wrote the 2007 novel on which the film is based, had already discussed specifics. Guadagnino said, “It’s gonna be a new movie, a different tone, you’re gonna see a lot of the East Coast of America… They’re gonna go around the world.” Photo credit: Vogue “In my opinion, Call Me can be the first chapter of the chronicles of the life of these people that we met in this movie, and if the first one is a story of coming of age and becoming a young man, maybe the next chapter will be, what is the position of the young man in the world, what does he want and what is left a few years later of such an emotional punch that made him who he is?” the director continued. When asked when fans could expect the film at the Oscars, Guadagnino replied: “We have to get there with the script, but we will.” And worth the wait it will be. Despite missing out on the Academy Award for Best Picture to Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water, Call Me by Your Name took home the statuette for Best Adapted Screenplay.
