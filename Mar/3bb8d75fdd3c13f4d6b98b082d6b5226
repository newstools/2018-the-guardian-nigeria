The event, held at the Upbeat Centre in Lekki, had nursery and primary school children competing for gold, silver and bronze medals in various events. The pupils participated in 100m race, 4×100 relay race, inter-school relay, cheerleading display, march past and other gymnastics games with Amber House coming out as the over all best. Speaking at the end of the event, the Chairman of the occasion, Mr. Kayode Otitoju said sports has a critical role in the physical and mental wellbeing of a child, adding, “there is no doubt there are budding Olympians amongst Marymount School athletes.” Principal of the school, Mrs. Naseem Sen explained that the objective of the day was to inculcate the fondness for sports in children and impart lessons in team spirit and fair play. She expressed satisfaction with the performance of the athletes, adding that in the school, pupils have regular physical exercise lessons intended not only to promote physical fitness but to also foster in the children a sense of team spirit and fair play. “And so our novelty sports day is usually a highlight of the year showcasing skills which have been acquired by the children,” she said.
