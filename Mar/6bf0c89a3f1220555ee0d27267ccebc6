Director General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Sir Joseph Ari The Director-General of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Joseph Ari, has said his agency requires over N5 billion to acquire an office and technical equipment to boost its Model Skills Training Centre (MSTC) in Abuja. He, therefore, solicited support from government, organisations and public-spirited individuals to meet these needs. MSTC was established as a post-secondary technical institution in 2019 but commissioned in 2011 to train technicians for the nation’s economy, and create opportunities for young school leavers and adults to acquire employable skills. The Director-General spoke yesterday while conducting journalists round the training centre in Abuja. Represented by MSTC’s Head of Administration, Lami Dakwak Selle, the ITF Chief said that no fewer than 50 students have graduated from the centre.
