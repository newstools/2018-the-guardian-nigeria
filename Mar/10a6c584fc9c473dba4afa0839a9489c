Meanwhile, the House of Assembly has set up a six-man committee to look into allegations of extortion at the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Enugu, in which first year students are forced to pay accommodation fee of N40,000 whether offered hostel accommodation or not. Speaker of the House, Edward Ubosi, was forced to constitute the committee, following the non-acceptance of the report presented by the committee headed by House Committee Chairman on Education, Matthew Ugwueze, earlier set up to look into the saga. The adhoc committee, which is to be headed by Chinedu Nwamba, representing Nsukka East, was given three weeks to look into the matter and report back to the House.The IMT seemed to be imbued in crisis, as it cannot access ETF financing because of its failure to complete projects awarded by the Fund.Two house members, Matthias Ekweremadu and Emeka Ogbuabor, representing Aninri and Isi-Uzo constituencies respectively, had spoken against the report presented by Ugwueze that did not indict any of the authorities in the institution nor the consultant handling the ICT- the Blue Tag Technology.
