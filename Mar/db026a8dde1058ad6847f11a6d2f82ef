The defense strategies, are the prevention, resilience and detection/recovery. According to Oyediji Simileoluwa, Senior Consultant at Digital Encode, at a Cybersecurity Masterclass Training for ICT Journalists in Lagos, said that prevention increases the difficulty of attacks, resilience allows a system to remain functional despite the attacks, while detection/recovery would allow systems to more quickly detect and recover from attacks to a fully functional state. Giving some tips to avoid cyber attacks, Simileoluwa asked organizations to realize that they are an attractive target to hackers, warning that don’t ever say, ‘it won’t happen to me’ as security is a journey and not a destination. He also advised that there is a need to practice good password management. “Use a strong mix of characters, and don’t use the same password for multiple sites. Don’t share your password with others,” he urged. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
