 High Court  The trial judge, Justice Josephine Oyefeso, gave the order following Ajudua’s absence that stalls his trial over alleged defrauding of a former Chief of Army Staff, retired Lt.-Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi, of the sum of $8.4 million while they were both in custody at Kirikiri Prisons, Lagos in 2004. Ajudua, together with his accomplices, allegedly approached Bamaiyi and convinced him that he could secure his freedom and also secure legal services on his behalf.When the matter came up for hearing, the defendant’s counsel, Allen Agbaka, informed the court about the current medical status of the defendant and prayed the court for an adjournment. He said Ajudua was evacuated to India on February 8, 2018 for an urgent medical attention, following a referral to Ruby Hall Clinic, India for surgery. Agbaka further stated that the defendant had written a letter to the court and attached his international passport, visa documents, and medical reports from Ruby Hall Clinic, India as well as photographs showing him on hospital bed in India.“Copies of the documents had been served on the prosecution counsel, I urged the court to adjourn the case for three to six months or sine die.” However, in his response, the prosecution counsel, Seidu Atteh, asked the court “to try the defendant in absentia, since the matter has been long in court.”The judge therefore adjourned the case till May 23, 2018 for the commencement of trial and also ordered the defendant to be present in court at the next adjourned date.
