Rauf Aregbesola, Governor State of Osun The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has denied contributing funds for the repair of Olaiya-Ita Olokan road which leads to the Osun Groove in Osogbo, the state capital. UNESCO’s clarification followed a statement credited to a former deputy governor, Iyiola Omisore, that the international organisation paid over 70 percent of the cost of reconstructing the 2.8-kilometre road. The Communications Consultant (Regional Office) of UNESCO, Mr. Olusola Macaulay, said the organisation was never requested by the Osun State government to fund the project. “We didn’t pay 70 per cent or any other fraction of the funds for the project, as being peddled. As I speak to you, we have no project we are undertaking in Osun State.” Governor Rauf Aregbesola described Omisore’s claim as a falsehood, revealing that the resources invested in the project were sourced from Omoluabi Infrastructure Conservation Fund. “UNESCO is not in any way involved in financing the project. It becomes imperative to state that rather than provide funds, UNESCO requested the government to re-work and change the course of the road which leads to Osun Groove, to retain its World Heritage Site status.

Rather, such is given in kind and not in cash, as the former deputy governor (Omisore) would want the people to believe.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
