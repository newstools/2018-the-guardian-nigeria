A Lagos assembled team, Preparatory School, Children International School, St. Saviour’s School and Greenville, Ikeja, as well as British School are currently competing in the league organised by Dynaspro Sports to uncover talents from the grassroots. Speaking at the weekend, President of the Nigeria Aquatics Federation, Babatunde Fatayi-Williamssaid, “The whole idea of the league is good as it provides regular competitions for children. These children will progress and develop skills, techniques, build stamina and competitive spirit. “I appeal to sponsors for support because it is difficult to organise a tournament of this magnitude. The Federation is very much behind the league and we will continue to give our technical support where required,” he said. The host’s school’s principal, Ashish Gill, said the swimming league has afforded the school the opportunity to grow talents among the students aside the platform to do so.
