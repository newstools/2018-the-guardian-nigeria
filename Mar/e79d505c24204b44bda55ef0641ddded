 President Muhammadu Buhari  The group made the declaration at the end of a summit held at the residence of the late Premier of the defunct Northern Region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, in Kaduna. Threatening to sack non-performing politicians in 2019, they warned: “No Northern politician should expect to be voted for in the next general election unless they demonstrate a willingness to champion a massive assault on poverty and underdevelopment in the North. In this regard, most political office holders from the North are hereby served a notice that they have failed the test to lead the region towards economic recovery and growth.” They added: “There must be vigilant scrutiny of opportunities for manipulation by outsiders of our present challenges. We must stand up and unite against those who kill villagers in Kogi, in Zamfara, in Benue, in Adamawa, in Borno, in Kaduna and in every village or town. No Northern blood is more precious than others, and we can only heal if we adopt common positions to finding solutions to our problems.” Signatories to the communiqué include: Prof. Ango Abdullahi, Amb. Ibrahim Mai Sule Arewa, Engr. Bello Suleiman, Dr. Ibrahim Yakubu Lame. Alhaji Yerima Shettima, Pastor Aminchi Habu, Rev. Bitrus Dangiwa, and Alh. Buba Adamah.
