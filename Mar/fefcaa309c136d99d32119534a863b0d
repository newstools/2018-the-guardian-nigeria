As a facial feature, the lips are one of the most sensitive assets of the face. It can be argued that—apart from the eyes– it is the most importance facial feature that can either enhance or diminish beauty. As such, it is very important to take care of this sensitive member of the face. Here are a few healthy tips that can help. Lipsticks are a mixture of wax, pigments, fragrance, oils and alcohol. Depending on the desired effect, these components are combined in different forms which generally are not good for prolonged contact with the lips. This is because they are made from chemicals which can have an adverse effect on the lips when used consistently. For daily use, it is advisable to go for tinted lip balm instead which should give the same visual benefits as the lipstick without the side effects. Save your lipstick for special occasions. Ultraviolet rays have the same adverse effect on the lips as they do the skin. It is important to use lip products with SPF to protect the lips from harsh rays that can cause darkening of the lips. Water is essential for general skin health as the human body is made up of at least 60% water. Of all the body parts, the lips are the least equipped to take care of themselves so when the body is dehydrated, they are the first to show the signs. To retain the natural colour and lustre of the lips it’s important to keep hydrated levels at high throughout the day by drinking sufficient water. Contrary to popular beliefs, saliva dries out the moisture on the lips instead of adding to them. The habit of licking the lips can lead to the darkening and chapping of the lips and biting put the lips in risk of damage. As an alternative, keep a moisturizing lip balm in your bag or purse at all times.
