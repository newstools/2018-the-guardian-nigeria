The much-talked about Ibom Deep Sea Port in Akwa Ibom State would soon be realised, as more than 100 companies across the globe have reportedly indicated interest for the development of the Port. This was disclosed by the State Commissioner for Housing and Special Duties, Akan Okon, while speaking with journalists in his office yesterday in Uyo. According to him, more than 75 per cent of the paper work, which would lead to the actualisation of the construction of the port has been achieved, adding that despite the interest shown so far in the project, the bidding is still open till March 16. He attributed the level of success recorded in the project to the commitment of the State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, whom he said brought to bear his experience in the private sector in project execution. He recalled that soon after assuming office, the governor set up a committee made up of experienced and seasoned people in the maritime industry to pilot the realisation of the port project, which was conceived about five years ago. Okon said the Ministerial Steering Committee met in Abuja, and approved procedures for procurement, which led to publication of qualification for expression of interest by port builders. “I am happy to tell you that as at today (February 27, 2018), the bidding is still open, and the response is encouraging. We have over 100 companies all over the world showing interest, and it
is expected more are coming. The closure is extended to March 16, 2018. “After that, the evaluation committee will meet to evaluate and come up with a preferred institution that will build the port,” he stated. The Commissioner, whose Ministry oversees the project, linked the high interest shown to the location and depth of the port.
