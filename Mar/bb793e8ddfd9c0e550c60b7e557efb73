Record high consumption amid days of freezing temperatures had led to a shortage of around 10 million cubic meters of gas a day. Ukraine on Friday urged schools to close and factories to cut production and asked citizens to chip in by lowering their home thermostats to save on gas. "You are incredible, thank you," Naftogaz tweeted on Sunday. "Briefly: everything is ok now," the statement said. "We have gas. Educational institutions are waiting for children on Monday." The latest flare-up in tensions between Moscow and Kiev came after an arbitration court in Sweden ordered Gazprom to pay $2.56 billion (2.08 billion euros) to Naftogaz for "failure to deliver the agreed transit gas volumes".
