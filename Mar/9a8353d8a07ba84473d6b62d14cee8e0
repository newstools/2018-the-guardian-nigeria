One of the freed Dapchi schoolgirls, Fatsuma, yesterday said overcrowded vehicles and stampede led to the death of five of them. She told her father via telephone in Hausa Language in Maiduguri on how they survived the 30-day captivity. Fatsuma had said: “Good morning my father. My name is Fatsuma. I thanked God that we have been released by Boko Haram. Five of our colleagues, including Aisha and Maimuna, died in transit between where we were held captive and our school in Dapchi. “My school mates died because of overcrowding and stampede in the Nissan vehicles we were being transported and dropped outside the college premises. “Some of us sat on other students, while traveling between Kangar hideout and Dapchi, our village, where we were abducted by the insurgents.” On how they were treated, she said: “They have been giving us food. And in most cases, the insurgents even allowed us to cook for ourselves. We were not harmed or tortured by any Boko Haram member since they abducted us from our school on Monday, February 19, 2018.” She further disclosed that even the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets could not identified the location where they were held.
