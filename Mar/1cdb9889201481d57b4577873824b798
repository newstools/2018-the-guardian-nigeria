 Dr. Leo Stan Ekeh, Chairman of Zinox Group,  The statement above – succinct and thought-provoking – represents one of the driving motivations behind the lofty ambitions of Nigeria’s tech giant, Zinox Technologies Ltd. which featured prominently in a brand new television commercial released by the company last week. The 60 seconds commercial, which hit the airwaves on Friday March 2nd, 2018 and expected to run for three weeks on a number of stations including Channels TV, Africa Independent Television (AIT), Silverbird TV (STV) and Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), is already attracting a huge number of positive reviews. The engaging and professionally-executed video is also set to hit the digital space this week. The commercial opens with the scene of a painter who proceeds to depict on a blank white canvas the landscape of an ultra-modern, technologically-advanced mega city, complete with spectacular high-rise structures, design concepts with floating gardens and parks and intricate transport systems using the latest technology. As the large mural comes to life, showing movement and giving the viewer the sense of life in this technologically-advanced city, the painter returns to the canvas, this time focusing more closely and delivering a measure of detail with his strokes. At the same time, we are immediately reminded that “our future is in plain sight but it takes those with foresight to see it.” The commercial proceeds to guide the viewer through the glowing credentials of Zinox: a world-class but Nigerian-based integrated ICT solutions company which has delivered unarguably some of the biggest tech projects on the African continent and with huge capacity to do more.
