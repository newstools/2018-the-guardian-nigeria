Fakeye  in Lagos/NAN PHOTO.  Akinterinwa made the plea at the 3rd Memorial Lecture for the late Gabriel Olubunmi Fakeye, the Spiritual Leader and founder of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Ayo Ni O), Lagos. The lecture was entitled: “The Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace – The Divine Panacea for Strong Nationhood”. Akinterinwa, who spoke on the theme, urged Nigerians to seek the face of God for peaceful coexistence. “Without a scintilla of doubt, there is no unity of purpose amongst the people, governance is largely characterised by ethnic chauvinism. “Nigeria has become a country where honours are given to those who should be in jail. Many things are wrong with the conductors of Nigeria. “Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace can be a good and divine panacea to Nationhood, if godliness is allowed in the political governance of Nigeria.” In his remarks, a cleric, Special Apostle Funsho Korode, decried the spate of killings of people and the wanton destruction of property in some parts of the country. According to Korode, life is sacrosanct and should not be toyed with. He is the General Leader, Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, Surulere District Headquarters (Ayo Ni O). Korode said: “The church is not happy at the wanton destruction of human lives and property either for political, economic or religious reasons. “In the globalisation world we are today, with the rapid assimilation of people into culture, Creeds and colours, it is saddening that as a nation, we have suddenly woken up into self-destruction. “Our choice of topic for discussion is centered on Baba Fakeye’s orientation and perspective that Christians have the responsibility, as appointed watchmen, to pray and stand in the gap for their communities and the nation. “This becomes more imperative and instructive, considering the situation in the country today with the ethno-religious bifurcation, implosion and social cataclysm being foisted on the nation by sons of disobedience and agent of instability.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
