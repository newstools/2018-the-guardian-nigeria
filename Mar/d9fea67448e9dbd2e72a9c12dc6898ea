 Enugu State goveror,  Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi  The new judges are: Linda Chiama Okibe, Veronica Chinyere Ajogwu and Esther Nnena Alukwu. Until her elevation, Okibe was the Chief Registrar of the High Court of Justice, Enugu, while Ajogwu and Alukwu were chief magistrates (Grade 1) of the state judiciary. Performing the ceremony, Ugwuanyi stated that they were recommended from a list of eight candidates, who were shortlisted by the Enugu State Judicial Service Commission for appointment as High Court judges. He noted that the appointment of the judges was a welcome relief to the Enugu State Judiciary, especially in the face of the current dearth of judges in the state. The governor pleaded to the NJC to consider the recommendation for more appointments to “enable us fill the many vacancies that currently exist in the Enugu State Judiciary.” While congratulating the new Judges on their appointments, Ugwuanyi expressed confidence that they would take their new responsibilities with dignity, integrity and commitment. Also speaking, the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Priscilla Emehelu explained that their approval from the NJC came after “a long and rigorous exercise” carried out by the state Judicial Service Commission after their nominations.
