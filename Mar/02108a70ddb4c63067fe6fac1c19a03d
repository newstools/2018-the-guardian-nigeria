Also in attendance was one of the richest men in the world and renowned philanthropist, Mr. Bill Gates.Kano State-born Dangote gave out the hand of his daughter, Fatimah, in marriage to the Zamfara State-born Jamil at a very crowd-pulling event. The marriage, which was consummated in one of the ancient inner palaces of the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, attracted the sum of N500, 000 dowry, which was received by the President, who stood on behalf of the bride’s father, Dangote. The exchange of the dowry was witnessed by a former head of state, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar; chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Senate President Bukola Saraki; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; Director General, Directorate of Security Service (DSS), Mamman Daura and Oni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi.While presiding over the religious rite, Sanusi advised the couple to be patient, persevere and respect each other’s value through mutual understanding and love. The emir emphasised that marriage is one of the cardinal tenets of Islam, which must be accorded the fullest respect by the couple.Others who graced the wedding Fatiha include governors Abdullahi Umar Ganduje (Kano); Mohammed Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa); Godwin Obaseki (Edo); Abdulfatah Ahmed (Kwara); Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina); Kassim Shettima (Borno); Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun); Ajimobi (Oyo); Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna); Yahaya Bello (Kano); Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto); Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo (Gombe); Abubakar Bello (Niger); Mohammad Bindow Jubrila (Adamawa); Mohammad Abdullahi (Bauchi), among others. Also in attendance were a host of former governors, ministers, senators, House members, captains of industries, technocrats, bureaucrats, ambassadors, top-flight businessmen, traditional rulers, Islamic scholars and religious leaders.There was, however, watertight security within Kano metropolis, as both uniformed and plain- clothed security agents were on red alert in case of any eventuality. Meanwhile, there was a mild drama at Meena Event Centre, venue of the wedding reception, as men of the DSS attached to the host governor, Ganduje and a private security outfit, K-Square Security, engaged the DSS personnel in a fight for yet-to-be known reasons.But this did not disrupt the ceremony.
