 Francis Uzoho  Uzoho looked jittery in the match won by the Eagles via a penalty call by the referee, which Victor Moses scored after he was fouled in the host’s 18 yards box. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Lawal said Uzoho did well against Poland, since that was his first time manning the post for the Eagles for the whole of 90 minutes. “Uzoho did a good job on Friday and like we all know this is his first time playing 90 minutes in a strong friendly match. I believe game after game he will improve; that is football for you. “It is not easy to be in that position, especially when everybody is clamouring for a good goalkeeper, after the manner in which the former first choice left the scene. Naturally, one would have expected someone who had understudied the first choice to easily takeover, but that was not the case here. Our problem is that we want a quick fix for the situation that we now found ourselves,” he said. The former Eagles winger, who spoke on the team’s feat, said Eagles are on the right track after securing the moral boosting victory over Poland, urging the team to step up her preparation towards doing well at the World Cup. “Though football is all about winning, but in friendly matches, teams are built up for major competitions. At times, results of these friendly games count to some coaches, whereas to others it is simply a building process. “Winning that encounter against Poland does not mean that Eagles are at their peak. It is a friendly game where lessons are learnt from a team’s mistakes, which will be used for other opponents. “With this result, it is now left for the coaches and the players to focus on their next warm up games, organise themselves and strategise before the start of the World Cup,” he stated.
