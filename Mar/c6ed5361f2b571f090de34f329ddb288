The preparation for Fashions Finest Africa Epic Show has begun in earnest. Over time a lot of people have changed the Nigerian fashion industry in many ways and the impact they make or have made have not been well recognised or appreciated. Fashions Finest Africa wants this to change and this is why they have decided to debut the Fashions Finest Africa Awards. The essence of the awards is to celebrate those who have made a mark in the fashion industry. This will be the first of its kind and the most prestigious fashion awards in Nigeria. The Epic Show would be a three-day event running from Friday 25th May to Sunday 27th May 2018 at The Balmoral, Federal Palace Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos.
It will be three days of nonstop fashion with a lot of activities for those in the business of fashion and for lovers of fashion. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-586225 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907.jpg 1000w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-974x974.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/epic-show-banner3-e1521706297907-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> To add to the package, there will be a runway show, exhibitions and conference.
