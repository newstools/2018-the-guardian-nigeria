Canadian telecommunications firm BlackBerry has sued Facebook accusing the American social media company of infringing on its patents for messaging apps. BlackBerry is claiming infringement on patents it holds for message encryption and notifications and is seeking an injunction as well as damages for lost profits, although no figure was given. <img class="size-full wp-image-93427 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blackberry-e1520409747679-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Facebook and its wholly-owned services Instagram and WhatsApp are named as defendants in the lawsuit. The company said it intends to fight the lawsuit. “We have a lot of respect for Facebook and the value they’ve placed on messaging capabilities, some of which were invented by BlackBerry,” BlackBerry spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said in a statement.

Facebook shot back by disparaging BlackBerry, saying the lawsuit “sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business.” “Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others. We intend to fight,” Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said. BlackBerry, after abandoning the manufacture of its once-popular smartphones, which it also pioneered, has refocused on cyber security software and services. ***AFP
