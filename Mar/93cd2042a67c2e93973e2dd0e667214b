The Chief Executive Officer, Total Value Integrated Services, Mr. Chris Onyekachi, has called on all stakeholders to support the re-development of the Ile-Epo market in Agbado/Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area of Lagos State.
 
Onyekachi appealed to them to cooperate with his company, so that it would not fail to deliver on the set date.
   
Speaking during a press briefing, he said the state government decided the market needed re-development because it didn’t befit the Mega City status of Lagos, let alone its Smart City aspiration.
   
He said there had been several meetings with different units and sections in the market on the way forward. He, however, expressed surprise that when some of his staff erected the billboard for the commencement of re-construction, some traders claimed the staff were unknown faces that had come to take over their market. “All the Baales in the area had been called to the local council to discuss this development and they all supported it. To me, it is injustice for someone to try to deceive the people that some contractors want to take over the market. It cannot be done. This is democracy, and things need to be done in the right way. And our governor is doing things the right way, so whatever we do in Lagos will follow the due process.
 
“We never went there with caterpillars; we just went there to erect the board. We have the documents of approval already. So, the protest is just to frustrate our efforts. We will not take that. Every necessary plan has been taken. We have a provision inside the market where some people will be relocated and we are not demolishing the whole market. I have agreed with them to do it in five phases, so that no one complains.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
