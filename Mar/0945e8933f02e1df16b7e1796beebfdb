Lannubo, a native of Bokos community, in Bokos local government area of Plateau State, was attached to Mopol 30, Bayelsa State Command and was deployed to Akenfa police station for patrol duties before the incident. The State Special Prosecutor, Arthur Andrew Seweniowor, had charged him to court for murder in accordance with Section 247(1) of the Criminal Code Law. Cap c14 Laws of Bayelsa State 2006. Lannubo, who admitted shooting Grand, however said he did so in line with his duty as a policeman, as the shot was to frighten the deceased who was trying to escape from arrest. The prosecution had called 15 witnesses, including the deceased wife and brother to prove its case that Lannubo shot Grand without any provocation on the fateful date. Seweniowor had argued that the three essential ingredients that prosecution must establish to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt had been established in the case. He said: “Unpleasant as it may seem that this court may come to the finding that the prosecution has proved this case beyond reasonable doubt and impose the ultimate and single sentence of death. Arriving at this decision is not based on any sentiment but on law. The prosecution had placed before the court sufficient facts to sustain a conviction and I urged with respect that judgment of guilty be entered in favour of the prosecution.” Justice Ineikade Eradiri concurred with the argument of the prosecution and therefore sentenced him to death by hanging. This is on the heels of a related development that the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, has decorated an officer accused of involvement in the ‘Apo six killing’. The officer, Danjuma Ibrahim, was decorated with the rank of Assistant Inspector General (AIG) at the Force Headquarters in Abuja on Monday alongside other police personnel. He was one of the 414 police personnel, whose promotion were recently approved by the Police Service Commission (PSC). He was reinstated into the force after 12 years of suspension. Before his suspension, he was the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of operations at the FCT Command. It was alleged that Ibrahim conspired with other officers to cause the death of some suspects arrested in Garki Division. The incident, which occurred in 2005, led to his suspension from the force and he was subsequently charged to court alongside Othaman Abdulsalam, Nicholas Zakaria, Baba Emmanuel, Ezekiel Acheneje and Sadiq Salami as co-defendants for felony. A statement issued last November by the commission’s spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, had explained the circumstances that led to his reinstatement. The statement reads: “DCP Ibrahim charged to court. The trial lasted 12 years, after which the judge found him, who was the first accused in the matter, not guilty and discharged him while Baba Emmanuel and Ezekiel Acheneje were sentenced to death. After the judgment, DCP Ibrahim appealed to the commission, requesting for his reinstatement.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
