It commended the Governor Godwin Obaseki administration for banning night grazing.
  
At a press conference in Benin City, the state CAN chairman, Rev (Dr.) Oyonnode Kure, said the association was planning a prayer session for the state and the entire nation later this month.
  
His words: “We are fully opposed to cattle colonies in our state. There have been so much killings, our women are being assaulted, our girls molested, people can’t go to farms anymore. Everybody in Edo stands against the activities of the herdsmen.
  
“We appreciate the positive steps taken by the state governor in banning night grazing. We are saying that government should put machinery in place to ensure compliance. The federal and state governments should be talking about establishing ranches as it is practised in the developed world.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
