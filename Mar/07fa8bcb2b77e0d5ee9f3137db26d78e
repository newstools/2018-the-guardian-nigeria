The two-day capacity building organised by Influence Consults Limited in collaboration with DEPOWA, had 60 military and police officers’ wives, among which were the wives of service chiefs and Inspector General of Police (IGP). President DEPOWA, Omobolanle Olonisakin, said the main objective of the training was to sensitise participants on current challenges in doing business and refreshing their minds on the management of SMEs. According to her, series of lectures and issues have been outlined for the participants during the training session and that lessons learnt would be replicated in moving the country forward.
