There will definitely be blood, and the thing is – you can definitely hear the leather, cracking on people’s heads, if you’re close enough as well, and we’re both fast. Aware of the quality of the unbeaten New Zealander, Joshua predicted the fight was going to be extraordinary. “You’ll see really good combinations that you don’t really see from heavyweights.” Joshua, who defeated Carlos Takam last October, stated he is a different animal compared to his last fight. “Every fight and training camp has been something to learn from. “Who I was for my last training camp, I just feel like I’m a different animal, more fine-tuned. I don’t just work hard anymore, I work smart, I’m becoming a real student of the game.” WBO Champion, Parker is unbeaten in 24 professional fights while Joshua has knocked out every of his 20 professional opponents.
