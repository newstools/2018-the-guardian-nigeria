After weeks of speculation, Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon announced her gubernatorial run on Twitter on Monday. As she explains in her first campaign ad, she was born and raised in New York City and believes it’s time for our government to change.

In recent years, she’s shifted her focus from acting toward politically charged causes, like the fight for funding in many New York City schools.
