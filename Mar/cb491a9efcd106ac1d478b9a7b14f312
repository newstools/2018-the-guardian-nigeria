Madu will be replaced as head coach by Ezekiel Onyegbulem, while Isaac Mbaegbu will move from the youth team to th senior team to assist the Onyegbulem. “In place of the Madu-led technical crew, the club has directed that coach Ezekiel Onyegbulem should take charge of the team. “He will be assisted by coach Isaac Mbaegbu who is recently in the club’s youth team, the Team B. The decision takes place with immediate effect.” The Naze Millionaires are currently on a poor slide, the Owerri side have lost all of their last four matches. Madu won the Nigeria National League with Heartland to gain promotion into the top tier. Things have not gone smoothly as the coach accused his players of sabotage in a quirky rant. “My players did not play this match for me or the club,” said the Madu after a 3-0 loss to MFM FC at the Agege stadium. “People have penetrated my team to destroy me. My enemies have penetrated into my players to destroy me and they have succeeded,” Madu continued. Heartland are 18th on the NPFL log with 13 points from 12 matches. Onyegbulem will take charge of Heartland’s game against Nasarawa United on Sunday at the Dan Anyiam Stadium. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
