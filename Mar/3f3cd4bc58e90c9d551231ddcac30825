 Justice Marshall Umukoro  Justice Umukoro disclosed this yesterday in Asaba, at a stakeholders’ meeting on criminal justice reform. He said the reform was in response to the calls for qualitative justice delivery, efficient prosecution of crimes and effective correctional institutions. The title of his message was: “The role of the rule of law and human rights in reforming the criminal justice system.” The chief judge added that the forum was aimed at bringing key players to interact and deliberate on the challenges in the sector. It is expected to foster inter agency collaborative synergy towards efficient, effective and qualitative justice delivery, especially on the criminal justice sector. He lamented the inability of prison authorities to reproduce awaiting trial inmates from prison custody in court for trail. He, however, noted that inadequate means of transportation had been a challenge, leading to undue adjournment and frustrated trials. The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Peter Mrakpor, said the justice system, if well managed, would lead to a better society. He said Governor Ifeanyi Okowa had mandated that the state’s different empowerment programmes be extended to the prisons. The Comptroller of Nigeria Prisons, who was represented by Mrs. Ngozi Okereke, said: “We have five prisons in Delta State which all are congested. Our problem is awaiting trials in our prisons and it’s a problem of the ineffectiveness of our judicial system and delay by prosecutors.” Also, the Executive Director, Citizens United for the Rehabilitation, Mr. Sylvester Uhaa, stressed that out of the over 70,000 prisoners in Nigeria, more than 50, 000 are awaiting trial.
