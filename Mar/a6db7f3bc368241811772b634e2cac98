Schoolgirls wait for the arrival of Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari at the Goverment girls’ science and technical college in Dapchi, Nigeria March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Ola Lanre Some of the schoolgirls kidnapped from their school in Dapchi, Yobe State, may have been freed by their abductors.
Sources said the girls were brought to Dapchi by persons suspected to be their Boko Haram abductors. “The girls have been brought back. They were brought in nine vehicles and dropped outside the school at about 8:00 am,” Bashir Manzo, who heads a group set up to support parents whose children were abducted told AFP. Five of the girls are, however, feared dead. About 110 girls were kidnapped from Government Girls Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State, on 19 February, in a raid President Muhammadu Buhari described as a “national disaster.” Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu described their release as a “thing of joy”.
