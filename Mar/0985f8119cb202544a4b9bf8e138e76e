Rihanna posted a comment about Snapchat, a social media application, and some of her fans took it as a direction to delete the app. Snapchat recently released an advertisement that appeared to mock the pop star’s domestic violence incident with her former boyfriend, R&B singer Chris Brown. In 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna in 2009 when a photo of her bruised face was released; the incident made headlines around the world. Rihanna Snapchat.

Both ad and game, however, were not affiliated with Snapchat.  Snapchat apologised for the ad, saying it was “disgusting and never should have appeared on our service.” In a statement, the company said: “We are so sorry we made the terrible mistake of allowing it through our review process. We are investigating how that happened so that we can make sure it never happens again.” This, however, didn’t stop the pop singer from speaking out. She wrote: “I know you know you ain’t my fav app out there! But I’m just trying to figure out what the point was with this mess! “You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV victims and made a joke of it!!! Shame on you. Throw the whole app-oligy away.” Shares of Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the company that makes the app, went down by 4.7 percent in trading. This comes at a particularly difficult time for the company, after its shares lost about $1.5 billion in market value in February after social media celebrity Kylie Jenner, who has over 105 million Instagram followers, tweeted that she did not like Snapchat’s redesign.
