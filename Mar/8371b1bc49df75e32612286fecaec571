William will be the first close relation of Queen Elizabeth II to make a official visit to Israel, following official trips made previously by the monarch’s cousins the Duke of Kent and the Duke of Gloucester. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed what he said would be “a historic visit” to his country. Junior foreign minister Alistair Burt said the upcoming tour was an “important and unique opportunity to promote diplomatic and cultural ties in the region”.
