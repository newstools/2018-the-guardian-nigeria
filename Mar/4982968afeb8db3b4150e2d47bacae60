They solicited the support of the eight non-Ukwa Ngwa council areas, assuring them that Ikpeazu would continue to treat every section of the state with equity, justice and fairness. The group announced this at Okpuala Ngwa parade ground in Isiala Ngwa North local council. The event was tagged: ‘The Great Ukwa/Ngwa Declaration – The Final Word of Ukwa/Ngwa People’. It was attended by traditional rulers and community leaders. This meeting, convened by Chief Reagan Ufomba, a founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former state leader of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), was the second declaration so far. The first, which took place 15 years ago at Aba stadium, was similarly convened by Ufomba to drum support for the re-election of former governor, Orji Uzor Kalu. During the declaration, the UN adjudged Ikpeazu to have shown unprecedented political will in tackling the problems of the state, hence it endorsement and declaration of him as its sole candidate for the election. The motion to adopt him was moved by a former Senate President, Chief Adolphus Wabara. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
