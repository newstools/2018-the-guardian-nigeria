Nigerian champion, Plateau United could not muster the two goals it needed to advance to group stage of the CAF Champions League when it hosted Tunisia’s Etoile du Sahel yesterday. The Kennedy Boboye boys had lost the first leg in Tunis by 4-2 and needed two unreplied goals to advance on the away goals rule. But it could only get a solitary first half strike by Tosin Omoyele to fall on the 3 to 4 goals aggregate. With its ouster from the Champions League, Plateau United will drop to the Confederation Cup, where it will join MFM FC of Lagos in the competition. MFM on Saturday crashed to MC Algiers of Algeria by 6-0 to exit the Champions League on a 7-2 goals aggregate. The Lagos team won the first leg 2-1 at the Agege Stadium.
