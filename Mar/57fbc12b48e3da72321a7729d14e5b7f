It’s easy!” the president wrote. “We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!” After weeks of rumors and counter-rumors about his administration’s intentions, Trump on Thursday announced he would sign off on measures designed to protect US producers next week. The tariffs — 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum — cover two materials that are the lifeblood of the construction and manufacturing sectors. The announcement was greeted with fury within key US trading allies such as Canada, the EU, Australia and Mexico, as well as rival China. It also caused jitters across global stock markets.
