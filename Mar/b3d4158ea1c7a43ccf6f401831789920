Nigerian Army A Federal High Court in Port Harcourt has fined the 6 Division of Nigerian Army, N1 million for gross abuse of human rights. The army was accused of abusing the rights of an actress and movie producer, Ebere Ohakwe, popularly known as Jewel Infinity. The trial Judge, Adamu Turaki Mohammed, said the arrest, harassment, torture and assault on Ohakwe by officers of the division on January 13, 2017, in Port Harcourt was unconstitutional and a violation of the dignity of human life. The court awarded N1 million in favour of the applicant against the defendants, and ordered the army division to tender an unreserved apology to the applicant. Justice Mohammed said the applicant had proved her case, adding that she was entitled to the reliefs she sought. The judge restrained the defendants from carrying out further unlawful actions against her. He said the submissions by the counsels showed that the applicant had proved her case and consequently resolved the case in her favour. He held: “The first, second and third respondents are restrained from further threatening, harassing, embarrassing, arresting, torturing or inflicting inhuman treatment on the applicant, except in circumstances provided by the law.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
