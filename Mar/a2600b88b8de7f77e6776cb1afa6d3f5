 Adamawa  During the attack on Kaya community, the insurgents abducted two children, while a female suicide bomber died when a bomb wrapped on her exploded in the early hours of yesterday detonated an explosive device attached to her body, as she was stopped from entering a mosque in Fulatari ward in Buni Yadi, killing herself and injuring three others in the process. The Adamawa State Police Command spokesman, Othman Abubakar, who confirmed the attack to The Guardian yesterday in Yola, said two of the insurgents were killed by soldiers who repelled the attack. “The Boko Haram members that carried out the attack abducted two children of age between 15 and 16 years. “They also took away a Toyota Starlet car and shot an 80-year-old man during the attack,” he stated. He said one rocket launcher missile was also recovered from the insurgents, while security operatives were on their trail.
