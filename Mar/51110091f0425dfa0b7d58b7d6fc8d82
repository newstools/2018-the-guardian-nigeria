When the couple is offered the chance to sail a yacht from Tahiti to California, they’re excited to plot out their adventure. But the category-5 Hurricane Raymond devastates their boat, sets them off course, and leaves Richard badly injured. Tami is left with the gargantuan task of keeping them both alive and sailing the boat to Hawaii, their only hope at survival. Directed by Baltasar Kormákur, Adrift is based on the true story of the real-life Oldham’s account of her harrowing 1983 ordeal. The film is slated to premiere on June 1.
