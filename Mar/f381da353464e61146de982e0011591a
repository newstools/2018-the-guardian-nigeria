Brazil superstar Neymar will watch from the stands as Paris Saint-Germain open their season on August 5, 2017, but the French club have already clawed back around a million euros on their world record investment. Neymar, who signed from Barcelona for a mind-boggling 222 million euros ($264 million), is presented to the PSG support prior to his new team’s first game of the Ligue 1 campaign against promoted Amiens.<br />/ AFP PHOTO / ALAIN JOCARD Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has visited injured superstar Neymar at his luxury home in Brazil amid rumors swirling about the striker’s intention to quit PSG. The star’s father, Neymar Santos Sr, posted pictures late Monday of the meeting on Instagram. “Visit of the day at @neymarjr! Thanks @PSG,” he wrote. In one picture, Neymar gives the thumb’s up, flanked by Al-Khelaifi and his father. Another picture shows the club president with Antero Henrique, sports director at PSG, and Jean-Martial Ribes, the club spokesman. On Tuesday they were expected to visit Neymar’s charity center, the Neymar Junior Institute, in Praia Grande, Sao Paulo state. The world’s most expensive player broke a bone in his right foot on February 25 and faces weeks of recuperation following surgery in early March. Unconfirmed media reports are swirling in Europe that Neymar has also grown disenchanted with PSG, who crashed out of the Champions League as the forward missed the second leg on March 6, and wants to return to Barcelona or even join rivals Real Madrid. Brazil’s national team is hoping the striker will be back to full fitness in time to help lead the campaign at the World Cup starting in Russia on June 14.
