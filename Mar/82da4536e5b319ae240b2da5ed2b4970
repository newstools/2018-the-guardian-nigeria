 Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson (right) with former<br />Governor of Delta State, James Ibori during a condolence visit to the government and people of Bayelsa over the death of Chief D.S.P Alamieyeseigha in Yenagoa…yesterday  Okowa noted that the voice of the marginalized Niger Delta people would never be drowned. He described Dickson and Ibori as two great sons of the Niger Delta region, adding that it only takes a wise man to make the wise choice of recognising these great men whom he said are bold, strong, courageous and good advocates of the region. Ibori assured that they will not let Kabowei Kingdom down as the interest and progress of the region was their major concern. “I am very interested in what goes on and we will continue to watch what goes on in the region. Any referendum will be based on the interest of the region.” While justifying the honour, the traditional ruler said that a man who has done very well will be celebrated by his friends and he was proud of the two awardees.
