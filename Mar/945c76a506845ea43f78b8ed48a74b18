The air was filled with excitement, and it instantly translated to bold expression of happiness and gratitude on the faces of the kids as the food train of Lagos-based Newcastle Food Company, promoters of the ready-to-eat Nau Nau meals, left the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps at Benue and Taraba states and arrived in Lagos. Venue was at Linking Hands Foundation in Iwaya Road, Yaba, where kids were feted to meals as part of the firm’s school feeding initiative. According to the Director of Newcastle Food, Miss Nsikan Udo-Osoh, the firm is reaching out to the less privileged through several initiatives and to other organizations beside Linking Hands Foundation. “The food that was donated to the foundation will at least last for a quarter. The product is an already-made food pack in four packages – jollof rice with chicken, beans porridge, fried rice and Egusi soup – and it can stay for 18 months before it expires. “Everything about the food is technology-driven. It is made in India with a Nigerian recipe, because we realize many Nigerians are busy people and it is not healthy to live on snacks, which is why we recommend our highly nutritious meal.” Mrs. Efe Farinre, coordinator of the foundation, expressed her appreciation for the gesture to the kids, many of whom were displaced from Otodo-Gbame. The foundation presently caters for over 350 displaced pupils who have been out of school due to the demolition of the shanty community in Ajah area of Lagos.
