 Members of the House of Representatives . PHOTO: TWITTER/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  The chairman of the ad hoc committee probing the debacle, Mr. Buba Yusuf Yakub, who briefed reporters at the National Assembly complex, Abuja yesterday, wondered how those who carried out the nefarious act could not be caught by security agents in the country. He expressed the fear that the nation could drift into a state of anarchy where only the fittest survives as against a situation where government guarantees the security of lives and properties of the citizenry. According to him, “it also suggest that our security challenges as a nation have become nastier and frighteningly comprehensive to such an extent that life in Nigeria has become short and brutish which is akin to the state of nation.” Yakub noted that the committee was to investigate the remote and immediate causes of the incident and report back to the House in four weeks. The panel, according to the chairman, is also to investigate the force level and presence of security personnel in Dapchi and neighbouring communities before and during the incident and also assess the situational awareness of the security forces in the area. The committee is also mandated to check if there was negligence on the part of individuals, group of individuals or organisations as well as investigate the action and inaction of security operatives before, during and after the abduction of the girls.Among other responsibilities, the panel is to equally probe the effort made and when such action commenced and the impact of same. Yakubu noted that the committee will, at the end of its assignment, apportion blame where necessary and make recommendations.
