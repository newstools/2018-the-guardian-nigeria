The first ever Bokwa Dance Festival in Nigeria held in Lagos last weekend at Eko Atlantic and Lagosians were treated to a very vigorous dancercise (dance/exercise) routine like never before. Using the letters of the alphabet to move and dance, participants were introduced to a new phenomenon that left them asking for more. Even children were not left out as Paul Mavi and Michael Sunny, the instructors, took both children and adults through different tasking routines, patterns and movements aided by music and aerobics. The Bokwa Fouder, Paul Mavi said he was invited to participate in the festival to introduce the movement properly to Nigerians and lend an international flavour. “Bokwa is nothing new, it is being danced all over the world and is the second largest fitness dance movement after Zumba. Michael (the Nigerian first Bokwa instructor) has been doing it for a while now but we want it to become a part and parcel of everyone’s routine. We want to come and introduce Bokwa to Lagos and it is our hope it will spread all over Nigeria. Speaking on the dance culture in Nigeria, the South African born but now living in the USA dance instructor said dance was a part of everyone as anyone could dance. “If you can listen to music, you can dance. Music makes us happy and the natural instinct is to dance when you hear music. You may be shy, but dance is a part of us, especially Africans, it’s in our blood.” Adding that he had no expectations when coming, he said he was in Lagos to simply have a good time, see people move and experience Bokwa with Nigerians. “It will take time but I believe Bokwa is going to take over the Nigerian dance scene in a year or two.” The event had comedy interlude, musical and dance performances as well as plenty to eat and drink. Kemen, Bally and Soma of last year’s Big Brother Nigeria season 2 were at hand to join participants in the dancercise. The event was sponsored by 2wice As Nice Ltd Team led by Obukome Ibru and supported by South Energy Nig Ltd (Eko Atlantic), Lagos State Ministry Of Waterfront Infrastructure and Developement, Aero contractors, Guardian Life, Ariya Tickets and K Square Securities.
