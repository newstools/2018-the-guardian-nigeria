Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has again cried out that communities ransacked by herdsmen are not safe for returning residents. He said this at the weekend when the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons paid him a visit in Makurdi. He explained that the displaced people are in a dilemma, as conditions at the camps are poor. The governor chided the commission for calling almost two months after the influx of refugees from Cameroon into the state was reported it. He advised the commission to be more proactive in the future. “It is the responsibility of the Federal Government and your commission to take care of the refugees,” he said. Ortom said he would continue to cry out until justice is served his people, stressing that ranching is the best way to end attacks by herdsmen.
