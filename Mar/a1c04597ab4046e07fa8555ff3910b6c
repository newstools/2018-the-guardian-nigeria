The Federal Government had delayed the signing of the treaty to allow for more deliberations and input from stakeholders, The government has set up a committee to work on the agreement before the President would sign it. Speaking at the 6th Africa CEO Forum in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, Obasanjo expressed the hope that President Buhari would sign before it is too late. “Egypt started the discussion about the formation of the Organisation of African Unity, but didn’t conclude it and Nigeria took over. Nigeria was central to the discussion of the free trade agreement, but I am surprised that the country withdrew from signing. “That President Buhari didn’t sign the free trade agreement in Kigali is disappointing, I hope he signs it before it is too late,” he said.

Since independence, we have never had any woman as president or vice president; no woman has contested governorship election and won. “In the coming dispensation, all organs of political parties should have 30 per cent slots for women,  30 per cent for the youth, and 40 per cent for the others.” The former president said it was disheartening that the number of women in the National Assembly in Nigeria was still very insignificant.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
