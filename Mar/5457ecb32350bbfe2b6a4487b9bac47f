 Darron Gibson  Republic of Ireland international Gibson was suspended by Sunderland after being arrested and subsequently charged following an incident that left several cars damaged close to the club’s training ground on March 17. The former Manchester United player’s departure from the Stadium of Light was announced on Saturday. “Following the conclusion of his recent suspension, Darron Gibson will leave Sunderland AFC by mutual consent,” a Sunderland statement read. Gibson, who is 30, joined Sunderland from Everton in January 2017, but was unable to stop the club suffering relegation from the Premier League. He has struggled with injuries and, combined with a lack of good form, that meant he was limited him to just 30 Sunderland appearances. Gibson, who had a groin problem at the time of his arrest, made the last of his 27 league appearances for Sunderland in a New Year’s Day defeat against Barnsley.
