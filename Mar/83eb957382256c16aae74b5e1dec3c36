 Plateau United FC  The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) champion had lost the first leg 2-4 to the Tunisia’s club side, through two questionable offside goals and will be hoping to upturn the advantage of their opponent. Two unreplied goals are what the Jos-based team needs to secure a place in the group stage of the lucrative African club competition. CAF had moved the match to Kano on account of the standard of the Jos Stadium complaint filed by the North African team. A Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Director, Bola Oyeyode, had told AFP that the venue was changed from Jos to Kano following complaints by the Tunisian side. However, Goalkeeper Okeimute Odah, has been ruled out of the battle after sustaining a knee injury, where CHAN Eagles’ number two goalkeeper, Dele Ajiboye, came in as a substitute and helped ensure a respectable score line for the NPFL’s defending champion. The Coach Kennedy Boboye-tutored side now has between Ajiboye and John Gaadi to pick from as goaltender for the crunchy tie. Meanwhile NFF President, Amaju Pinnick, has urged the Jos-based team to eliminate the Tunisia’s side from the competition, which has remained elusive to Nigerian clubs since Enyimba of Aba won it last in 2014, by defeating the same Etoile Du Sahel.
