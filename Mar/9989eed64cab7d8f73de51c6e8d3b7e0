 Moshood Abiola Polytechnic,  Abeokuta (mapoly)  The Guardian learnt that the students are protesting against the alleged refusal of the school’s management to release their results. Among those affected are HND students due to be mobilised for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). The heavy presence of the policemen foiled the protest from holding, as the students were forced to stay at home. The policemen, including the Special Anti-Robbery Squad were deployed in Ibara, Panseke, Onikolobo, Iyana-Oluwo and Oloke areas of Abeokuta. The areas are few kilometers to the institution’s location, where most of the students reside. Policemen at the school’s main entrance also turned back some students who attempted to attend lectures. Crisis had hit the institution in January 2017, when the state government announced plans to transform the institution to a university. The controversy that followed led to a three-month strike by the academic staff of the institution. Upon their resumption, the lecturers conducted the second semester examination, but have since refused to release the results. Reacting, the Chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Students, Ogun State chapter, Olawale Balogun, described the situation as unfortunate. He said: “It is unfortunate that the students have found themselves in this mess. We are suffering for what is none of our business, have played our own part as students.
