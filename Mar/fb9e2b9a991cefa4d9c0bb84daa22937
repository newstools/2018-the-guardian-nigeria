It’s finally Paris Fashion Week, the fourth city of the world’s major fashion week, and Kendall Jenner is yet to be seen on the runway. While most top models in the world – a la Gigi Hadid and Joan Smalls – make it a priority to walk in shows like Marc Jacobs and Versace, Kendall Jenner seem to have other priorities. According to sources that told People: “she had other working commitments this year. Kendall always decides last minute what she is walking in. It depends on the money and how she is feeling”. Kendall in a recent episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians complained of anxiety and planned to take measures to curb it. This year alone Kendall, who was named the highest earning model by Forbes last year, has already covered different editions of Vogue, V, W and Harper’s Bazaar. She is the face of Calvin Klein Underwear, Adidas ambassador and a slew of other deals. Kendall, though, might still work for the upcoming Balmain show, where she’s a staple at.
