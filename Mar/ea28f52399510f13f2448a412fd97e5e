 Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh, Primate of all Nigeria (Anglican Communion)  Speaking yesterday at the 2019 Women Family Sports Fiesta organised by the Anglican Diocese of Abuja, he said women are very important to the society and that the Church is encouraging those that are God-fearing and who can effect changes to contest. “Women should get mobilised for politics. You cannot rule out the greatness of women in terms of causing things to happen. Women vote more than men.
But this time around, we want more women to contest for elective positions. We discovered that most times, women are their own obstacles. But we want to erase this concept in their minds and let them know that they are very important and should be part of what is happening in the political process,” he said. He urged women to participate in the ongoing registration exercise. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
