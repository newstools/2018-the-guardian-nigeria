 Executive Secretary, TETFUND, Abdullahi Baffa  “It is my view that private universities are contributing immensely to the growth and prosperity of Nigeria. Our university is poised to achieve academic and moral excellence in the world. Our graduates are versatile in Information and Communication Technology, which is why they adapt smoothly to workplace conditions and excel everywhere they go.” Ajibola, who spoke amid preparations for the 10th convocation ceremony of the university, said his institution has a lot to offer and is poised to promote academic and moral excellence among its students, thus enabling them to cultivate impeccable integrity. Speaking on the institution’s Bola Ajibola College of Law, he described the law graduates as outstanding and among the best in the world. “Through our quality teaching, they are taught normative logic as a new epistemological system of analytical reasoning and cognition. These new branches of knowledge render previous assumptions obsolete. As knowledge doubles every three years, it improves the quality of our alumni,” he said.
