“Devil’s favourite demon” and the other half of the “brothers of destruction”, Kane, is contesting for Mayor of Knox County in Tennesse. Kane, whose real name is Glenn Jacobs, is running as a Republican for the election which comes up on May 1. Not many thought he was serious when the 50-year-old declared his intention last year but his new step of getting his other “brother of destruction” and frenemy, The Undertaker (Mark Calaway) involved has made them change their minds. People were allowed to take pictures with the two at the Rothchild Catering and Conference Centre for prices ranging between $50 to $150. Seriously an awesome birthday present yesterday getting a picture with Undertaker & Kane at the same time!! Love how the professional picture came out!!

We wait to see how this will turn out.
