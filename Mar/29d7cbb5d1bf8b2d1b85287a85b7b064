It’s possible to invest time in a relationship that isn’t going anywhere simply because one party is not as committed or heading in the same direction. Here are some sure signs that tell when he is clearly not serious about your relationship. When a guy is serious about you, he treats you as a priority. There will be times when he falls short or lacks the ability to follow through on his words, but this should not be business as usual. If you notice that he cancels on plans all the time and is generally aloof about the things that concern you, he is definitely not interested. Being open is a sign of trust and this usually comes with time. You should not expect him to be open with you a 100% at the beginning but there should be some progress. The decision to start a relationship with another human being is a clear sign that you are willing to learn to trust this person. If you realise that he closes himself up when you are around, wears a mask and refuses to show any vulnerability, it might be time to let him go. Entering a relationship with someone ultimately means you’re becoming a part of your partner’s life. You have to realise that this person had a life before you and it may take some time for you to adjust to his world and vice versa. However, if you find that your partner is deliberately trying to keep your existence as a secret from his friends and family, it might be a sign that you should call it quits.
