Senator Magnus Abe Alleges crisis in state APC
Senator Magnus Abe has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s planned visit to Rivers State is intended to enhance security in the state. Abe, who represents Rivers South-East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, said Governor Nyesom Wike’s position on the president’s forth-coming visit to the state was misconceived. The senator, an All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirant, said the governor should be grateful for the president’s visit, stating that whenever the date is fixed for the visit, everybody involved, including the governor would be duly informed. “Rivers State has been in the news for the wrong reasons of recent. I think the governor should have been the happiest person to hear that the president is coming to the state to see those people who have lost their loved ones and empathize with them. “It should be an opportunity for the governor to find a way to work with the president to ensure that we have a better security, but because of the undertone of the violence in Rivers State, I think that is why he finds the visit uncomfortable at this time”  the senator said. Abe urged Wike to put the interest of Rivers State first and not politicise the security of lives and property of the people. The lawmaker blamed the problem in the APC on the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, whom he alleged had formed his own group in the party, making it difficult for party members to meet to discuss the affairs of the party.
