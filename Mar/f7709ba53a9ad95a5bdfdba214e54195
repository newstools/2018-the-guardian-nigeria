Adebule thanked Coca-Cola for partnering with the state, saying, “The sports centre will provide a platform for the positive engagement of our youths and the discovery of talented young people who will make career out of their skill, and contribute to the growth of the economy. “I appeal to other corporate organisations to partner with the state government in sponsoring the state’s developmental projects as replicated by Coca-Cola. I believe the funding of local projects such as this should not be the sole responsibility of the government. We need more private-public partnerships like this to develop the state.
