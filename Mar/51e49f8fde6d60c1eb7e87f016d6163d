When did you discover your passion for music? 
I choose to go into music because music is a soul, life, joy to me, I always sing what I feel and it’s one thing that gives me joy mostly, the music thing started from secondary school, where I had the platform of singing to a thousand student, because of how committed I am to the music, they made me the chapel prefect and I was able to express my gifts by leading the  scripture union, I lead the devotion every morning in school .from there I was Bold enough to face the and the street with my music, because I met people from all Classes of life. Describe your style of music?
I can do rock Gospel, R%B, worship but My style of music is totally different from every other Gospel artiste, because  my titles always sounds controversial, imagine a Gospel artiste writing a song about she, sex, Obi , cross over night etc. First when you see the title of this songs, it makes u start thinking if it’s a gospel song or a secular song, I think my song titling makes it unique.
But when you listen to the message of the songs that is where you appreciate the uniqueness of my song. What’s your take on Nigerian gospel artistes?
