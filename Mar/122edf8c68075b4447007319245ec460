 Muhammadu Buhari  The state commissioner for information and Orientation, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, who stated this, said development of the area would depend largely on unity.Â According to him, the unity of purpose exhibited by the successes of the forbearers of the Ogbia people in the past was responsible for the premier positions held by Ogbia sons before now. The Commissioner made the assertion when the Forum of the Community Development Chairmen across the four clans of Ogbia kingdom paid him a courtesy call in his office in Yenagoa, adding that present political leaders in Ogbia must work together and shun tendencies propelled mostly by greed and selfishness. He also shared the concerns of his guests with regards to the prevailing insecurity in Ogbia, advising that as Community Development Committee (CDC) chairmen, they must work with the security operatives and government to end the menace. Speaking on the issue of insecurity in Ogbia, he advocated community policing as an effective antidote to bring about peace in communities but requested government support in this direction. He also alerted the state government on the activities of the herdsmen, who are recklessly destroying farms at Onuebun, Otokpoti, Otuasega among other Ogbia communities and called for immediate action in order to forestall breakdown of public peace.
