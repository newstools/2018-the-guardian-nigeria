Following the success of her make-up line, Fenty Beauty, Rihanna is rumoured to be working on an underwear line. The full details of the underwear label are still undisclosed, but TechStyle Fashion Group, the parent company behind Kate Hudson’s activewear collection, Fabletics, and other subscription shopping sites like ShoeDazzle and JustFab has reportedly struck a deal with Rihanna for an exclusive collection of undergarments. Reps for Rihanna and TechStyle are yet to comment on the claim, but some sources told WWD that TechStyle has been working to bring the project to fruition for more than a year, and design samples have already been produced. The success of the underwear line, judging from her other projects will be astronomic; everything Rihanna touches turns to gold.
