He said: “During the raid, there was an altercation between the hoodlums and the police resulting in the death of two of the hoodlums and the death of a policeman. Based on that incident, on Wednesday, I personally led all senior officers of this command and a total number of 500 policemen to the following places: Akala, Itire, Odoeran canal areas all within Mushin, Surulere areas, in search of some of the hoodlums responsible for the death of the policeman.” “For many years, Akala has been a criminal stronghold where gangs, fueled by the proceeds of Indian hemp sales, have held sway, using the proceed to acquire arms and ammunition to challenge security operatives. “At the end of the raid, we arrested the following: In Akala, we arrested 91; in Itire, Odu-eran canal where hoodlums murdered the LSNC personnel, 165 persons were arrested, in total 256.” The Guardian gathered that for two nights, on Tuesday and Wednesday, policemen raided the Akala/Idi-Oro area of Mushin at about 11:00p.m. to pick up hoodlums.
