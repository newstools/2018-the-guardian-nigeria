 Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu  The call was contained in a statement by the OYC President, Okechukwu Isiguzoro and Secretary, Okwu Nnabuike.The youths asked those calling for Ekweremadu’s arrest to channel such energy towards the killings in Benue, Plateau and other states of the federation. According to them, Ekweremadu’s statement was misinterpreted to mean a “military takeover of government.”The group warned that it would not watch as the deputy senate president is being intimidated. While promising to resist any attempt to arrest him, they stressed that they would rise to his defence, if it becomes necessary.They said: “We have followed with keen interest the controversies that have so far trailed a very honest statement made by the distinguished deputy senate president on the floor of the Senate. “Without mincing words, all honest men and women in the country cannot feign ignorance of the various abuses of the country’s laws by governments at various levels.“Suffice it to say that Ekweremadu merely stated the obvious by cautioning Nigerians not to take our much-cherished democracy for granted.”The youths lamented that some enemies of democracy had misinterpreted the honest statement to mean that he called for a military coup.
