A new relationship is always filled with rainbows and butterflies. Popularly known as the honeymoon phase, this period should not distract new partners from the realities of a relationship. Keeping that in mind, here are a couple of issues that a people in a new relationship should address early.

However, it is important to have this conversation to be certain that no one is carrying baggage from an old relationship into a new one. Often times, the impressions left by past lovers or partners are very subtle and do not rear their heads until the relationship has progressed considerably. This is the reason why this conversation needs to happen as early as possible so as to clear the air. This is an equally important and sensitive topic. Even if the two parties have already had sex, it’s still a conversation that needs to come up eventually. If both parties have not gotten tested for STIs, they can decide to go together. However, if one of them hasn’t been tested, the other party can offer to come along for support. If one of the parties is hell bent on not taking a test, they probably have something to hide. You do not want to be in a relationship simply for the glam and sparkles, you need someone that you will vibe with and want to spend time with. With these in mind, you need to find out what your partner does for fun and how he/she spends alone time. This information will prepare you for the journey you’re about to embark on. Another important thing to note is the way your new partner handles negative moods and emotions. Often times, people tend to change when they are dealing with negative emotions and this is a side of your partner you need to prepare adequately for.
