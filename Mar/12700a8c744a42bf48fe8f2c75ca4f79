Commenting on the A/W Presentations, participating designer MAXIVIVE said “This is my best experience at Lagos Fashion Week. Not only because it was a presentation, but I also had the liberty to create my show as I imagined. I believe we should explore developing more presentations that are adoptive of this style.” His thoughts were echoed by SISIANO who presented on day two. “As a creative, The A/W Presentations gave me creative license on the look of my show and representation of my pieces which I loved. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-591691 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_0026-e1522250106440.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" /> On Monday, 26th March 2018, #LFWNG also launched Fashion Focus Fund powered by Fets Wallet, the mobile money payment platform of choice for the sector, to support emerging designers.
