 President Muhammadu Buhari addresses a gathering during his visit to troubled Taraba State on March 5, 2018. PHOTO: SUNDAY AGHAEZE  Shonibare spoke in Ado Ekiti while inaugurating the State Interim Contact and Mobilisation Committees of the party.He said the party is determined to use the July 14 Ekiti governorship poll as a test case and prelude to the calamity that will befall the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the country in 2019, having allegedly ran the country’s economy aground through bad policies. “We are determined to take over Ekiti. And I know it will be easy for us because Nigerians are tired of both APC and PDP,” he said.“Nigerians are suffering. No jobs, no industries, no security, nothing is working and they want to hold onto power, this is impossible. Shonibare urged the members of the committees to run a transparent and open door policy, reminding that it would be an herculean task to take over power from an incumbent governor, Dr. Ayodele Fayose. Present at the occasion were party National leaders, led by former Minister of Education, Prof. Tunde Adeniran.Former Chairman of the Ekiti Inter-party Advisory Committee (IPAC), Dr Dele Ekunola, is to chair the 14-man State Interim Committee while the former Registrar of the Ekiti State University, Chief M.O. Ogundipe, is to chair the contact and mobilization committee. Adeniran pleaded with the party to shun discrimination that could rip the party apart, saying working in one spirit would enhance cohesion needed to upstage the APC and PDP in the coming election.
