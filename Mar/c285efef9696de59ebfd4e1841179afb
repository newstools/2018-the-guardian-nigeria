Brymo has released new visuals for Heya!, the lead single of his sixth studio album OSO. In this video, the afro-soul can be seen walking about almost naked– save for a brown leather looking piece covering his groin area. Later on, he is shown playing the grand piano before the camera zooms out to reveal a beautiful aerial shot of the Lagos highway. Watch the video here.
