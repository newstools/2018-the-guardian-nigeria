Often times men get confused about the proper interpretation of masculinity in a relationship. The idea of ‘weakness’ makes it difficult for some men to share emotions—especially the damper emotions—with their significant others. However, research has shown that the expression of these feelings goes a long way in strengthening the bond between couples in a relationship and is a sign of emotional maturity. For men who are having difficulty with this, here are a few tips that might help. Honesty with your partner is very crucial to the success or failure of your relationship but more importantly, you should be true to yourself. Be honest about the emotions you’re feeling and your internal experiences no matter how embarrassing they might seem. Admitting the existence of those emotions is usually the first step to emotional maturity. After admitting these feelings, the next step is learning to communicate these feelings. You can begin by speaking about random thoughts or emotions that do not necessarily have any consequences. Practicing with these little things will gradually prepare you for sharing the deeper things that you feel. It takes a level of trust to be able to depend on someone but it’s a level of trust that must be developed if the relationship is going to last. Most men want to prove their independence but relationships only thrive when there is interdependence. Interdependence stems from the ability to realize that as much as you are your own man, it is okay to depend on her sometimes and that dependency doesn’t make you any less of a man.
