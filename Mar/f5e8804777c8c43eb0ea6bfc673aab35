The incident occurred 80 miles (130 kilometres) from the Ghanaian capital but the plane “landed safely in Accra without further incident”, it said. It was the latest in a string of incidents involving the aviation sector over the past month. On February 7, an emergency exit door fell off a Dana Air jet as it landed in Abuja after flying in from Lagos. Six days later, an Atlanta-bound Delta airlines jet was forced to return to Lagos after a fire was detected in one of its engines with passengers using emergency slides to evacuate the plane, officials said. On February 17, an Air Peace plane had to delay landing in the southwestern city of Akure because cows had strayed onto the runway. Another Dana Air plane overshot the runway at Port Harcourt on February 20 due to heavy rain and flooding. And on Wednesday, the Nigerian government ordered a complete audit of Dana Air’s operations to determine the technical fitness of its fleet. The airline was grounded after a 2012 crash outside Lagos that killed all 153 on board and six on the ground. Mechanical failure and pilot error were blamed.
