There is enough anticipation as it is for the Oscars scheduled for February 2019. Fans, producers, actors are wondering and speculating about films that will win in different categories at the Oscars. The Academy has just announced that there will be a new category, which is created around achievement in popular film. This will give films not in the running for the Oscars perhaps an opportunity to win an Oscar plaque and a spot in Oscar history. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president John Bailey who is serving his second announced this the creation of a new category being designed around achievement in popular film. Change is coming to the #Oscars. Here’s what you need to know: – A new category is being designed around achievement in popular film.
– We’ve set an earlier airdate for 2020: mark your calendars for February 9.
– We’re planning a more globally accessible, three-hour telecast. pic.twitter.com/oKTwjV1Qv9 — The Academy (@TheAcademy) August 8, 2018  The award will take effect from 2020 so there will probably be no awards yet although it seems fans are already listing films that are worthy of receiving the award in this category. Bailey added, “It’s not about recruiting new people in the established industry. It’s going out and saying, ‘Who out there around the world should be enriching the motion picture Academy with their gifts and their history?’” This category created gives an opportunity for films around the world to be chosen based on its excellence. Perhaps Nollywood will continue to up its game to be in the running.
