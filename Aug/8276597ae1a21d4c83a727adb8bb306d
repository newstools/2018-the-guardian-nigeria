Sequels are indeed the thing! After over 30 years, Top Gun sequel ‘Maverick‘ was in the making with Tom Cruise reprising his role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell. Other top acts to star include Ed Harris, Val Kilmer and Jon Hamm. According to the film director John Kosinsky, the film was looking at the difference between the military and warfare 30years ago and the modern times. He said, “This world has not been explored,” he said. “It is very much a world we live in today where it’s drone technology, and fifth-generation fighters are […] what the United States Navy is calling the last man-made fighter that we’re actually going to produce. “So it’s really exploring the end of an era of dogfighting”. When filming started in May, Tom Cruise posted a picture on his social media page that got fans buzzing. #Day1 pic.twitter.com/7jjPL277Es — Tom Cruise (@TomCruise) May 31, 2018  The film was set to have been released in July 2019 but Paramount Pictures have announced that the film will be released in June 2020.
