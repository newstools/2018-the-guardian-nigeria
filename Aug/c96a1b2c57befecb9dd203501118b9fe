Another tanker fire accident was averted yesterday, when a fully loaded 36-litre aviation fuel-laden truck strapped to a rickety towing van disconnected and rolled down the airport connecting bridge at Toyota Bus Stop, along Apapa-Oshodi expressway. The fuel tanker, apparently had mechanical issues, but the owners forced it unto a toying van, which came off under the heavy weight of the fuel truck. In the process, the driver managed to divert the truck unto the refuse heap at the bus stop, which helped to wedge it precariously. A passenger vehicle was trapped under the truck, but occupants managed to escape unhurt, but with sever damage to the vehicle. Rescue efforts are on, but as at time of filing this report, no concrete step had been taken, because of the risk involved in lifting the fuel truck without it being evacuated. Owners of the truck are not making themselves visible and the registration number had been yanked off, apparently to conceal ownersâ€™ identity. The accident happened at about 7.00 pm Saturday, but the truck was still bedraggled across the airport link bridge, making it impossible for vehicles going towards airport to have access at 11 pm when this story was filed.
