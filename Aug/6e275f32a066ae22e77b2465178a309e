Everybody makes mistakes. Even the best beauty expert can have a beauty fail. But it important to learn from them and avoid a repeat although some people tend to overlook this and make these beauty mistakes a regular routine. The nails should have a consistent length and shape whether they are natural or false. Some people wearing false nails leave some on while others have fallen off. If one has fallen the others should be promptly removed. Perfume Everybody wants to smell nice but do not make the mistake of thinking that choking people is appealing. Resist the urge to cause vomiting and headache and apply subtly to the neck and wrists. There is no need to drench your clothes in perfume. It is odd when the face looks youthful, well moisturised and toned while the neck looks old and neglected in contrast. Whatever beauty regiment used on the face should be extended to the neck as well. Applying foundation.

Foundation should be well applied and blended in to the hairline, jawline ad the neck to achieve a natural look.
