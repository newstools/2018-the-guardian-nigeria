Joromi singer Simi has been on the radar, especially sampling songs like Ebenezer Obey’s Aimasiko and creating hits for live band performances for events. Now, the singer has shared a cover of Skepta and Wizkid‘s recent collaboration titled Bad Energy. Listen to her cover below: So… I love Energy by @skeptagram & @wizkidayo . And it was stuck in my head. . So I had to do something about it. (Listen with headphones) . I miss making covers just for the love of it . Actually, if you’ve followed my music from early on, you already know how we do. Lol.  – @i.y.a.n.u.o.l.u.w.a . PS: I got the beat, which is a remake of the original, off of youtube.
