PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari who is supposedly fighting corruption is surrounded by corrupt people. This is after a week when the president’s party All Progressives Congress (APC) claimed that Buhari’s fight against corruption during campaign in 2015 as been “hugely successful” since he was sworn in. However, the opposition PDP believes the claim of integrity by which President Buhari was elected is questionable. “Here is a President who is surrounded by corrupt people, people who have corruption cases hanging on their necks. Where then is the much-touted integrity of the man?” PDP spokesperson Kola Ologbodiyan said. “If you claim not to be a thief, but you are surrounded by thieves, you eat with them, open your doors for them and play with them? Are you not supposed to be worried?” “Where then is the integrity? Every suspected corrupt person is becoming your friend. Everyone being tried for stealing and corruption is wining and dining with you. Then you say you have integrity,” “President Muhammadu Buhari has shown Nigerians his friends and we now know the kind of person he is,” Ologbodiyan said. Ologbondiyan, who spoke with newsmen in Abuja, said the President could not have sincerely claimed to have succeeded in the fight against insurgency and revamp of the economy as well. The PDP spokesperson also debunked the claim by the Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, that the performance of Buhari’s government was satisfactory to God.
