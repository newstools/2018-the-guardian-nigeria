Spain has so many traditions and cultural celebrations, one of such celebrations is the Antzar Eguna which means the day of the geese. It is celebrated by the Basque fishing town of Lekeitio in Spain. It is a competition held as part of the San Antolin festival. During this festival, a goose covered with oil is tied to a rope and suspended in the middle of the river. Then participants ride on a boat and try to grab it and cut off its head. This is quite a difficult feat to achieve because spectators sometimes grab the rope to make it tighter and hence the competitors are dipped in the river. Antzar Eguna.

Surprisingly the prize is that the winner keeps the goose. Although some people will wonder if itâ€™s worth the risk, it is a festival that they cherish and host every year in the first week of September.
