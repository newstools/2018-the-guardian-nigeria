Belguim striker Michy Batshuayi has agreed a season-long loan to Valencia from Chelsea. The striker, who spent the second half of last season at Borussia Dortmund, is moving to the Spanish club in search of regular football. Despite an impressive display at the German side Borussia Dortmund last season, Chelsea new head coach Maurizio Sarri could not guarantee Batshuayi a first-team shirt. Chelsea will receive a large loan fee for Batshuayi and have not included an option for Valencia to buy him at the end of the loan. Batshuayi’s decision to go could mean Tammy Abraham, who has spent the last two seasons on loan at Bristol City and Swansea City, remains at the club. Batshuayi joined Chelsea in July 2016 for a fee in the region of £33m. He scored 10 goals for the Blues last season before a loan move to Borussia Dortmund, where he scored nine goals in 14 appearances. Batshuayi made three appearances for Belgium at the World Cup in Russia this summer, scoring a goal after he came off the bench in the 5-2 group-stage victory over Tunisia. Chelsea also announced on Friday that 23-year-old French defender Kurt Zouma will spend the season on loan at Everton.
