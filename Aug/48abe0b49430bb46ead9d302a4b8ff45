Getting an education is very important so much so that it has been classified as a human right in most societies. Graduating from college or university is, of course, an achievement. People work so hard in school to ensure they have a degree certificate. Some people are known to cram so much knowledge in their brains to be good on paper but perform poorly in a typical work environment. Google among other companies are no longer particular about the college degree but are particular about the skills a prospective employee has. Candidates are considered based on their knowledge and skills not exactly how it was acquired. This is indicative that having a degree does not necessarily mean quality job performance.

Apple, at $939 billion, remains the highest-valued private company on the global markets — and could well cross the $1 trillion finish line after it releases its quarterly results Tuesday. / AFP PHOTO / Emmanuel DUNAND Other companies that offer employment without college degrees include:
