Nigeria’s acting president Yemi Osinbajo has sacked the director-general of the country’s secret service following the service’s operatives blockade of the National Assembly on Tuesday. Masked operatives of the Department of State Services earlier on Tuesday prevented lawmakers, staff and journalists from entering the National Assembly. Opposition lawmakers accused the ruling all Progressives Congress of being behind the blockade which saw the lawmakers locked out of their offices. The clerk of the National Assembly was also refused entry to the Assembly complex. Daura, who was summoned to the presidential villa by the acting president few minutes before his sack, was directed to hand over to the most senior officer of the DSS until further notice. “Acting Yemi Osinbajo has directed the termination of the appointment of the DG of the DSS, Mr. Lawal Musa Daura,” said Laolu Akande, media aide to Osinbajo. “Mr. Daura has been directed to hand over to the most senior officer of the State Security Service until further notice.” Osinbajo also described the unauthorized takeover of the National Assembly complex as a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all acceptable notions of law and order. He said the unlawful act which was done without the knowledge of the Presidency is condemnable and completely unacceptable. “Prof. Osinbajo is consequently assuring Nigerians that all persons within the law enforcement apparatus who participated in this travesty will be identified and subjected to appropriate disciplinary action.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
