NCC Boss, Umar Garba Danbatta Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)‎ has said that it would continue to ensure that consumers of communications enjoyed the services expected to be provided by the Service Providers. Speaking at the 97th Edition of Consumer Outreach Programme (COP), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, executive vice chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)‎, represented by Alhaji Ismail ‎Adedigba, deputy director of Consumer Affairs Bureau at NCC, stated that the customer is king. “At NCC, we believe customer is king and as such, we must accord consumers their basic rights which include the right to be heard, right to be educated, right to choose, right to redress as well as right to safety,” he stated. He disabused consumers’ fears against mast erection near residential areas. “NCC has full-fledged monitoring and complain department that ensure that service providers do not mount masts and towers where not suitable. However, WHO says radiation from telecom masts does not have any health effect. Masts and towers do not have any negative health implication,” Danbatta further stressed. Also speaking, Mrs Felicia Onwuegbuchulam, director of Consumer Affairs Bureau at NCC, stated that the outreach “educates telecommunications consumers and other stakeholders on contemporary issues generating interest in the industry” as well as “serves as a feedback mechanism for the Commission towards regulatory interventions.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
