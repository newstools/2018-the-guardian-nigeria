Lagos,Nigeria Photo The Guardian Nigeria Eko o ni baje! According to the latest 2018 Global Liveability Index released by The Economist Intelligence Unit and World Bank, Lagos state has been ranked the third worst city for humans to live in the world as it scored a total point of 38.5% points and ranked 138 out of the 140 cities considered for the ranking. However, this is a slight change from the 2017 ranking when the state was ranked 139th out of 140 cities on the index
Scoring a relatively low score of 38.5 percent, the city was just a little above Syria’s war-torn capital, Damascus, and Bangladesh’s Dhaka as these both cities are hotbeds of violence, destruction and war. This new ranking had Melbourne, Australian capital coming second and losing the title of the world’s most liveable city by a 0.7% drop after a seven year reign to Vienna which had the overall score of 99.1% and the Japanese city of Osaka was adjudged the third most liveable city having climbed six positions, to third place, over the past six months, closing the gap with Melbourne. While the EIU attributed Vienna’s rise to the top to increased security scores due to a return to relative stability across much of Europe after high-profile terrorist attacks in recent years, the ranking was based on Social Stability, Healthcare, Education, Culture and Environment and Infrastructure of 140 different cities in the world. Also according to the ranking, Lagos only outperformed Dhaka in Bangladesh and Damascus in war-torn Syria.
Other African cities that got featured on the index were Dakar-Senegal, which was ranked 131, Algiers-Algeria ranked 132, Doula-Cameroun ranking 133, Tripoli-Libya ranking 134 and Harare-Zimbabwe ranking 135 all out of 140 other cities.
