 The Popcorn Palace Before you roll your eyes and ask how we can review popcorn, Popcorn Palace is not a regular popcorn place. Being the first of its kind to my knowledge, curiosity drove me to Block 124, Plot 10, T.F Kuboye Road, Lekki Phase 1 on a cool Wednesday morning. My initial plan was to have a waffle, slush and popcorn but I was disappointed on arrival. Apparently, it takes 40 minutes to get the waffle machine ready, which was annoying to hear as a first-time customer. This was definitely popcorn heaven filled with flavours from as caramel to barbecue. The attendant told me a lot of customers preferred the caramel flavour, which was like having the normal sweet or salty flavour to me. I played safe as I ordered a mix of raspberry and blue-raspberry flavoured popcorn. It would have truly been an experience if it came in a different pack that allowed for the easy mixing of the flavours, so you taste the variety. Yet, my mix was great! Each flake of popcorn was large and properly coated. I ordered the large size and I was in for a surprise because I couldnâ€™t finish it all by myself. From frozen chocolate to slush drinks, Popcorn Palace is certainly for those with sweet cravings. I decided to go for a strawberry slush, in hindsight I should have had frozen chocolate to complement the popcorn. I did not enjoy the slush as I did the popcorn because it had an aftertaste that reminded me of nasty cough syrup. Will I go back to Popcorn Palace? Definitely! This time, with a lot of friends, so we can have all the flavours and maybe order a waffle if we can. Popcorn mix: 850
Strawberry slush: 900
