Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday resumed its membership registration exercise nationwide. According to the party’s acting spokesperson, Yekini Nabena, the exercise would take place in all 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). He said the recommencement of the exercise followed the approval of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. The party added that its leadership took the decision in response to the calls from members of the public interested in joining the party to support the ‘Change Agenda’ of the Muhammadu Buhari administration. Nabena said the exercise will include both fresh registrations and revalidation of existing membership for the purposes of issuance of the party’s permanent membership cards. He further urged supporters and members across the country to take advantage of the exercise. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
