 NRFF President, Kelechukwu Mbagwu.  According to the federation, Weir would be in charge of the Black Stallions’ international warm up game against Niger Republic slated for Niamey on August 11. Addressing journalists yesterday in Lagos, NRFF President, Kelechukwu Mbagwu said plans had been finalised for 30 players, made up of 29 home-based stars and one foreign-based player, to begin training for the high profile friendly in Abuja this weekend. The friendly is the first international game the Nigerian side would participate in after recently returning from sanction imposed by the African rugby body. Highlighting NRFF achievements after one year in office, Mbagwu said the body’s ability to draft a new constitution, which has been ratified by Rugby Africa, has paved the way for the ban on Nigeria being lifted. The development has also brought Nigeria back to the international scene. “The Niger Republic friendly was put in place to gauge Nigeria’s level in rugby. It is an important clash because after lifting the ban on Nigeria, Rugby Africa instead of forcing Nigeria to start from the lower level, decided to organise a friendly with Niger Republic, who is the rugby Super 16 champions in Africa. Nigeria will also play against Ghana.
