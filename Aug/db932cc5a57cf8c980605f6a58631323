National Chairman of Nigeria’s major opposition party, People’s Democratic Party, Uche Secondus has called on the United Kingdom to expel President Muhammadu Buhari from her country. The Chairman alleged that Buhari, who is currently in London on vacation, planned the Tuesday morning National Assembly siege from there. The National Assembly was sieged by masked operatives of the Department for State Services, preventing lawmakers from entering the assembly complex. Secondus noted in a statement that the President left the country to UK for 10 days medical leave to enable the “nefarious activities they lined out against democracy be executed in his absence.” He said the UK should not allow its environment be turned into a haven for anti-democracy conspirators. Secondus said the final plan for the invasion of National Assembly was made when the outgoing Senate minority leader, Godswill Akpabio, visited the president in London at the weekend. The party last week accused the APC government of planning to invade the National Assembly and impeach Senate President Bukola Saraki, who only recently defected to the PDP from APC. It said President Buhari’s 10-day holiday in London was a part of the grand scheme aimed cowing the National Assembly, especially members of the assembly that are in the opposition. However, Secondus commended Acting President Yemi Osinbajo for sacking Director-General of the DSS Lawal Daura. Osinbajo also described the invasion of the National Assembly by the DSS agents as “a gross violation of the constitutional order, rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
