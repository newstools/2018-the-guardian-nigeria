Speaking on the firm’s gesture, the Managing Director of the outfit, Mr. Seleem Adegunwa, said: “We believe that ordinary people are capable of delivering extraordinary things, and so we always get involved with such things as sponsorship, corporate social responsibilities and the likes in one form or the other.” He said the firm supported the 2018 Asaba Championships with products worth several millions to support athletes and spectators at the championships. He added that the decision to support the event was due to the firm’s believe on sports uniting the nations, bringing out the best in the youth and adults and facilitating peace in the world at large. Adegunwa, who pledged the firm’s continuous support for sports initiatives, said: “Rite Foods is also represented fully in manpower at the championship to activate and ensure everyone experiences the spirit of sportsmanship through our ISO certified products.” A member of the Planning Committee, Asaba 2018, Mr. Bukola Olopade, commended the firm for their support, saying the championship is enjoying the partnership with Rite Foods as the official beverage of the championships.
