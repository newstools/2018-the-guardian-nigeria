FRSC Boss, Boboye Oyeyemi. As muslim faithfuls celebrate Eid el Kabir, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned motorists against drunk driving, overloading and other infractions during the celebration. The Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi Oyeyemi in a Sallah message urged motorists to stay away from acts capable of jeopardising lives of people on the highway. He also called for patience and collective vigilance on the roads to make the celebration hitch-free for road users as a reflection of the spirit of sacrifice which the season symbolises. According to him, Eid el Kabir is traditionally a feast of sacrifice which provides an opportunity for all Muslims to reflect on the sanctity of lives and mercies shown to mankind by God as evidenced by the substitution of a ram with the life of Ismail. He further noted that the lesson of the sacrifice demonstrates how God takes the sanctity of lives and need for people to take measures that can ensure human safety. “The magnanimity shown to Prophet Abraham by way of God substituting a ram for the life of his son, Ismail as is being observed in the Eid el kabir celebration is a great lesson for mankind,” he stated. Oyeyemi assured members of the public that FRSC is commited to ensuring safer road environments before, during and after any celebration stating that adequate numbers of personnel and logistics have been mobilised for effective traffic management, rescue operations across the country. He enjoined the people to avoid acts capable of exposing their lives and that of their neighbours to dangers during the celebration. Oyeyemi also appealed to members of the public to contact the FRSC Call Centre through the toll-free line (122) in the event of a road crash and other emergencies for a prompt response. He said all FRSC facilities would remain open and functional during the celebration and beyond to attend to members of the public.
