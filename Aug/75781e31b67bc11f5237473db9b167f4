 Members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC)<br />. PHOTO: NAN  Director-General of NYSC, Brig.-Gen. Suleiman Kazaure, who disclosed this when he visited the FCT Orientation Camp in Kubwa as part of his tour of orientation camps across the country, said the scheme received a letter to that effect from the Presidency that was also copied to the Minister of Finance. “The Federal Government is working to increase your monthly allowance. Hence, wherever you find yourself, be of good conduct and worthy ambassador of your family, the scheme and the nation. “We received a letter from the Presidency, that is, Ministry of Youth and Sport, copied the Ministry of Finance that shows that corps members’ allowance will be reviewed upward, it is in the pipeline,” he said. He, therefore, advised the corps members to reciprocate the gesture by taking advantage of the Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) so they can assist government in creating jobs. He said the corps members should consider themselves privileged to serve the nation, be patriotic and uphold the mandate of the scheme. “Immediately after your orientation, you will be posted out, you should respect the tradition of your community. “Avoid indecent dressing, be security conscious, and avoid night party. Night party is allowed in your lodge but aside your lodge, this is not allowed,” he advised. Besides, Kazaure gave his mobile phone numbers to enable the corps members reach him for any complaint and information. Meanwhile, the FCT State Co-ordinator, Mr. Ballama Birniwa, who noted that the 2018 Batch “B” corps members had been well mannered, said the director-general had banned the use of firewood in the camp kitchen, hence gas will be provided for cooking.
