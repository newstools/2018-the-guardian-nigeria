 [file] Leader of the Biafra Zionists, Benjamin Onwuka  It reinstated its commitment to take over Enugu State Government House on Monday, August 20, and declare Biafra’s independence. The President of the group, Mazi Benjamin Onwuka, told reporters in Enugu that the action was a testament to the ‘rejection’ of the Buhari government and ‘acceptance’ of the movement. He said: “Nigeria is beginning to feel the repercussion of what Buhari has done to the country. Yesterday (Wednesday), the U.S. announced the closure of its consulate without reason. There is a reason for it and we are aware of it. It is a red card for Buhari and freedom for Biafra. “The details are there. We know what is going on behind the scene. It is all over for Buhari and his Nigeria. “What we have been doing is now yielding results. We have always said it that the U.S. is backing our Biafra struggle, supporting our stand that Biafra should be independent. Israel is also totally behind what we are doing. “That is why we are standing today to re-echo our stand that the mass killings of Biafrans will end on August 20. There will be no compromise on this particular issue. “There is no group or tribe that has been massacred like the Biafran people. “You can recall the detention and harassment of politicians from this part of the world. That is why everybody must come out on August 20 in Enugu. Don’t be afraid. America is behind us. There will be no shooting, harassment or intimidation. We are going with stick and carrot.” Onwuka urged Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to desist from interfering with the activities of the group, noting: “He is our brother. We have no problem with him. All we are saying is that he should allow us to do what we want to do on August 20 which is to cease Government House and announce Biafra. There will be consequences if he tries to resist us.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
