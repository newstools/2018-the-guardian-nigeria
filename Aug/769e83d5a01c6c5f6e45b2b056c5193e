The suspect, Isaiah Ezekiel, who was employed barely a month before he committed the crime, was sent to distribute 150 bags of sachet water to retailers within Lekki. Apprehension, however, set in after frantic efforts to reach him on his mobile phone when he did not report back failed, as the phone was switched off. Also, a visit to his apartment at Jakande First Gate, Lekki, revealed that he had left the house with members of his family, as the door was under lock and keys. The suspect confessed that he sold the truck for N250,000, out of which he only got N100,000. He said: “I did it because I needed money to buy baby milk for my six-month-old baby. I was employed as a driver without salary but on commission basis. For every trip, I got N500. I manage to make a trip a day, which is not enough to transport myself and eat, let alone feed my family. Sometimes, I used the N500, which ought to be my commission to buy fuel because we were not given money for fuel. “On May 20,2018, I took some bags of sachet water to sell as usual, but I dropped the bags at my place and took the truck to a mechanic who took me to Ladipo market, where he sold it for N250,000. The buyer paid N200,000 with a promise to pay the balance when I bring the affidavit for the document. The mechanic collected N140,000 and I took the rest. I immediately went home and told my wife that we were leaving for the village because Lagos was too hard for me. I was in the village when the police arrested me.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
