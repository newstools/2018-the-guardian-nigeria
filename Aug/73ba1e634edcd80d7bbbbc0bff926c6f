A 29-year-old farmer in Ondo State, Mr. Segun Daniel, has reportedly killed his mother-in-law, Beatrice Lajuwomi at a farm settlement in Igbotako, an ancient town in Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state. 
 
The Guardian gathered that the suspect had a fierce row with Lajuwomi, 42-year-old, on Saturday over the custody of his child who had been living with the deceased for the past few weeks. The argument later resulted to a free-for-all between them. A reliable source, who disclosed that the argument resulted into violent clash, revealed that the daughter of the deceased, Olamiotan Lajuwomi, had a child for the suspect, but they were not living together as couple. According to her, Olamiotan and the child were living with the victim in the farm settlement. The suspect always kicked against the child living with the family of his wife, demanding to take up his custody.
 
She explained that there had been series of disagreements between the suspect and the family of his wife over who took over the custody of the child. “On Saturday, he went to the house of his mother-in-law where his wife and child were living and wanted to take his child from the woman but they did not allow him. This led to an argument between them and later ensued fight ensued. During the fight, he punched the woman and she collapsed and shortly after passed away.” The source added that the suspect took to his heels after the incident happened and nobody knew his whereabouts as at press time. But the state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Femi Joseph, who confirmed the incident, said the command had started the search for the suspect, while investigation had also begun into the matter. “Immediately after committing the crime, the suspect ran away and we have been looking for him. I am sure he will be arrested and face the full wrath of the law,” Joseph said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
