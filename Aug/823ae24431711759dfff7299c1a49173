Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The Presidency Wednesday said President Muhammadu Buhari had foreknowledge of the decision to terminate the appointment of erstwhile director-general of the Department of State Services (DSS), Lawal Musa Daura by Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo. Officers of the DSS on Tuesday laid siege on the National Assembly Complex in Abuja, thereby preventing lawmakers from entering their chambers, but left after sacking of their former boss. The acting president appointed Matthew Seiyefa in acting capacity. Reacting to insinuations that the sack of Daura was not approved by President Muhammadu Buhari who is on holiday in the United Kingdom (UK), the Presidency said, “There is no way there won’t be unanimity on that kind of decision.” Special Adviser to the President on media and publicity, Femi Adesina made the claim while fielding questions from the State House correspondents after the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, presided over by the Acting President. Adesina said the decision was unanimous as the Presidency was one. “What we will like to say for the umpteenth time is that the presidency is one. Whenever the President is proceeding on vacation he transmits power to the Vice President, who then become the acting president. On this occasion, he also did that,” “So, the acting President has all the powers of a president. Now it’s a matter then of decency and we know that the acting President is a decent man, there is no tussle for power, there is no tough battle between him and the president,” “When something like what happened yesterday will happen, there then will be unanimity. There is no way there won’t be unanimity on that kind of decision. It’s not something that will be discussed with the press but know that there was unanimity in the decision,” Adesina said.
