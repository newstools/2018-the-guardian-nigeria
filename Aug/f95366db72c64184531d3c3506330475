Or not! Since the split of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Jolie has reportedly been out to “get blood” from her ex-husband. TMZ reports that Jolie is claiming that Pitt has not been paying any “meaningful child support”. However, sources are saying that this is not true as he has paid “way, way more” in millions of dollars than he agreed to. According to TMZ, she stated in her legal document he has not meaningfully contributed any quota but their source has called it “a joke” and cannot wait for the truth to surface. Recall that her lawyer, Laura Wasser, is allegedly quitting because of her state of mind and she has become unhealthily vengeful.
