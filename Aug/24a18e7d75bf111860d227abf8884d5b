It has come to the point when a vast majority can agree with the saying, “the future is tech” as Nigerian women have bought into it. Only some fifteen years ago, the topic of many secondary school debates had been “Is Technology a Blessing or a Curse?” Perhaps those discussions have yielded good fruits as Nigerian female mediapenuers keep venturing into the tech space. Few months after the lunch of her YouTube channel, Nigerians turned heads to watch ace millionaire blogger Linda Ikeji manifest as a force to be reckoned with in the Nigerian media and entertainment space. With original award-winning contents such as Hot Topics and a host of others, LindaIkeji TV became one of the go-to networks for many. Linda Ikeji.

At some point, people were almost certain that Ikeji had signed a deal with one of the biggest cable networks in Africa, and she has gotten a platform on it. But she, it seems, had a different plan as she announced the launch of her streaming platform, LindaIkeji TV, a few months ago. Creating original contents that cut across reality TV, documentary, series and other shows, LindaIkeji TV is gradually becoming to Nigerians what Netflix is to the world. Just while we were trying to get our heads around the launch of Ikeji’s streaming platform on the app stores, Nigerians received double blessings as EbonyLife TV’s media mogul CEO, Mo Abudu, announced EbonyLife TV’s venture into tech with the launch of a streaming platform EbonyLife On, in app stores. Mo Abudu, CEO of EbonyLife TV EbonyLife TV, which has produced movies like The Wedding Party, Fifty and others, launched EbonyLife ON with a brand new series exclusively to the app, Castle and Castle. Of course, not all mediapenuers are launching streaming platforms on app stores. Some others are looking for ways to make work in the media easier. OAP-turned-producer Fade Ogunro also ventured into the tech space earlier this year with a booking platform for media practitioners named Bookings Africa. The website creates a space for people in need of media practitioners, including voiceover artists, models and the like, to be booked without stress on the website. This initiative of hers, she says, came as a result of her challenges as a producer in Nigeria. Fade Ogunro.

The likes of these women have chosen to dispel the narrative by moving into tech not only to further make life easier for Nigerians but to also bring about technological advancement to the country.
