PHOTO:YOUTUBE Turkish club Konyaspor has sacked Ex-Cameroon captain Samuel Eto’o with two years still left on his contract. Eto’o joined struggling Konyaspor from rivals Antalyaspor in January 2018, scoring six goals in 14 appearances to help the club maintain their top-flight status. The Turkish club said the former Chelsea and Everton striker, 37, has had his deal cancelled, “on the basis of a previously agreed negotiation”. “We hope that he will bring beauty, happiness and success to his future plans.” a statement on the club’s website said. The club also thanked him for “his services on behalf of our colours”. The four-time African footballer of the year winner has been widely linked with a move to Ligue 1 in France, as well as a possible return to Spain. A three-time Champions League winner, Eto’o moved to Antalyaspor in the summer of 2015 as the keystone of the club’s bid to find national and even European success. Eto’o enjoyed much of his club success at Barcelona, where he played from 2004 to 2009, and has also had spells in Russia, England and Italy. He also won the Champions League under Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan in 2010, and has an Olympic gold medal, which he won with Cameroon in 2000. Eto’o holds the record of highest goal scorer in the Nations Cup with 18 goals. He as appeared at four World Cups – 1998, 2002, 2010 and 2014 – scoring three times in eight matches.
