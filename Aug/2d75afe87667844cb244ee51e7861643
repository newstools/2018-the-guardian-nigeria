Speaking on the upcoming event, COSON Head of Public Affairs, Mr. Chibueze Moses Okereke said the sleek red-carpet event like no other, will climax the week-long funeral program of the massively loved music legend. He said: “The event will be strictly by invitation. We know that people from all walks of life would wish to attend this big event especially as the sleek tribute night is being personally produced by the COSON chairman, Chief Tony Okoroji.” “Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate everyone, so if you get the invitation, please honour the event because it means that you belong to a select group. Members of the Kimono family have met several times with our chairman over the tribute night and I have no doubt that it will be talk of the town,” he added. Also speaking about the COSON tribute night, COSON General Manager, Mr. Chinedu Chukwuji, said that the late Kimono was not just a COSON member, he was a 100 per cent committed member of the society, and totally dedicated to the COSON cause. He said, “As a hyper creative person, he fought against anything that will destroy COSO, as he saw the organization as a watershed development in our country and an important legacy for the Nigerian creative industry. No one should forget that until he passed on, Ras Kimono was a key member of the COSON board and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with our Chairman, Chief Tony Okoroji through every challenge.
