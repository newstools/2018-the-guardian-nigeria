 Bayern Munich’s Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal arrives for a trainings session of the German first division Bundesliga team FC Bayern Munich in the team trainings camp in Rottach-Egern, southern Germany, on August 3, 2018.  / AFP PHOTO / Christof STACHE  The 31-year-old midfield dynamo was whisked away from Bayern’s pre-season training camp in Bavaria and several media outlets claim an announcement of his transfer to Barcelona is imminent. According to Spanish newspapers Mundo Deportivo and AS and UK daily The Guardian, Barcelona are prepared to pay 30 million euros ($35m) for the box-to-box midfielder. Vidal would reportedly receive a three-year contract and earn around nine million euros per season with the Spanish giants. The Guardian claims Vidal met Barcelona officials last week and has already passed his medical after being granted permission to leave by the new Bayern manager Niko Kovac. Bayern officials reportedly want to move Vidal on and reduce their star-studded squad. Having signed rising Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka, 23, on a free transfer from Schalke, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said earlier this week that they have too many midfielders.
