 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL – JUNE 23:  Police are out in force for a protest by the group Will Not Have Cup who were demonstrating against the World Cup being held in Brazil and overspending in the construction of stadiums during the game between Brazil and Cameroon, June 23, 2014 in Sao Paulo Brazil.

The macho criteria were part of the psychological profile demanded for candidates in 16 different types of job, all of them open both to women and men. Masculinity was defined as “an individual’s capacity to remain unmoved by violent scenes, to put up with vulgarity, not to become emotional easily and not to have interest in romantic episodes or love.” After criticism from a national gay alliance, the Brazilian attorneys’ association and the Parana government, the police rewrote the rules. The new version substitutes masculinity for “endurance” and deletes the clause on romance.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
