PHOTO: udinese.it Nigeria international defender William Troost-Ekong has joined Italian club Udinese from Bursaspor for a reported €3.3 million. Troost-Ekong had given a lengthy tribute to Bursaspor fans on Thursday after the deal for the centre-back was agreed. The transfer to the Friuli was only confirmed and announced on Friday afternoon. “Ekong is a player with an important physical structure,” Udinese Technical director Daniele Pradè “Skilled in the air both in defense and attack. We are talking about an aggressive central defender, strong and with an excellent game reading. “A reflexive, non-instinctive leader who always tries to play the ball, all characteristics that go very well with the game of coach [Julio] Velazquez.” The defender made 27 Turkish Liga appearances, scoring three goals. He featured in Bursaspor’s 2018-2019 league opener against Fenerbahce, where he got a goal. Troost-Ekong featured in all three of Nigeria’s group stage matches in the 2018 World Cup. The 24-year old joined Bursaspor from Gent in 2017 for €1m, having previously played at Tottenham Hotspur, Gronigen, Dordrecht and Haugesund. Udinese play their opening Serie A match against Parma on Sunday. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
