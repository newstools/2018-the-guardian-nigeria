But Bashiru Ally, secretary-general of the ruling party, the CCM, told a public meeting on Saturday: “We will not be intimidated, we cannot be intimidated. “Even if our country is poor, we are not ready to accept interference in our governance. We will continue to govern ourselves,” he added. Local media earlier reported the beating and hospitalisation of some members of the main opposition by supporters of the ruling party. Churches and civil society organisations had also highlighted political violence around local elections, particularly the perceived bias of security forces in favour of ruling party candidates. The US statement came amid sustained criticism of the rule of President John Magufuli who has cracked down on dissent since taking office three years ago.
