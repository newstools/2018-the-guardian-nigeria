In July, MultiChoice raised the subscription rate for the DSTV Premium package from N14,700 to N15,800, Compact Plus from N9,900 to N10,650, Compact from N6,300 to N6,800, Family from N3,800 to N4,000, and Access from N1,900 to N2,000. The implementation of the rates commenced on August 1. However, on Monday, Justice Nnamdi Dimgba granted an injunction restraining the Pay televison company from implementing the new rates. The court also restrained MultiChoice from any conduct capable of interfering with the regulatory process of the Consumer Protection Council (CPC). The orders were granted in Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/894/2018 Federal Republic of Nigeria v. MultiChoice Nigeria Limited. Representing the Federal Government were Babatunde Irukera Esq, Abimbola Ojenike, Eme David-Ojugo, Moray Adebayo, Teniola Medupin and Florence Abebe.
