Senate President Bukola Saraki on Tuesday in Ilorin said he dumped Nigeria’s ruling party, All Progressives Congress because Kwara State was marginalised in terms of appointments by the party. He also noted the insistence of his supporters in Kwara that he should decamp and the guidance he received from God made him leave APC. Saraki on Tuesday evening announced his defection from APC back to People’s Democratic Party (PDP). “Today, I start as I return to the party where I began my political journey, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP),” Saraki said. While speaking to newsmen Saraki said “We discussed this issue last week when I came home. You told me that you were tired of the APC, but I asked you to exercise patience. I told you that I will seek God’s guidance and feed you back on my return to Ilorin. “The Federal Government appointed over 200 persons into juicy offices without allotting any slot to me or (Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu) Dogara. Everything went to Katsina, Katsina, Lagos, Lagos. If not for the love I have for Nigeria, we would have scattered everything. They don’t want us in their party. They don’t like us in Kwara.” Saraki in a press statement while announcing his defection described it as “difficult but inevitable”. He blamed this on some members who allegedly “ensured that the minimum conditions for peace, cooperation, inclusion and a general sense of belonging did not exist”. He, however, concluded that his departure from the APC does not make him enemies with the party.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
