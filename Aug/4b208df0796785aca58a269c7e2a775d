Photo: Twitter/UcheSecondus  National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has reacted to yesterday’s siege that prevented members of staff and lawmakers from accessing the National Assembly. He asked the United Kingdom (UK) to expel President Muhammadu Buhari, who he said, was hiding in that country to plan an assault on Nigeria’s democracy, adding that Britain should not allow anyone to turn that country into a haven of anti-democracy conspirators. Secondus pointed out that President Buhari left the country to UK for a 10-day medical leave to enable their plans against democracy to be executed in his absence.He alleged that the final plan for the invasion of National Assembly was sealed when the Senate minority leader, Godswill Akpabio, visited the President in London at the weekend. According to him, the siege to the National Assembly left no one in doubt that President Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are out to destroy the country’s hard earned democracy because they can no longer fit properly into it. Secondus also commended Acting President Yemi Osinbajo’s courage in sacking Director General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Lawan Daura, to show that Nigeria could no longer be hijacked by a cabal.He argued that globally, democrats do not need any further evidence to show that the President and the APC have suspended democracy and were now running a draconian administration. Meanwhile, the British High Commission has condemned yesterday’s siege to the National Assembly by the DSS.Spokesperson of the United Kingdom Embassy in Abuja, Joe Abuku, said in a statement that it would only accept a democratic process that recognises the rights and wishes of Nigerians. “The UK supports a process where Nigerians can exercise their democratic rights to vote and be voted for. We favour a free, fair, credible and peaceful process and the independence of institutions, which allow that,” he added.The statement followed calls by representative of Bayelsa East in the Senate, Ben Murray-Bruce, that foreign sanctions should be meted on those involved in the National Assembly saga To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
