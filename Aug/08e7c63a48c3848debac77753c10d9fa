Show us a man who can use his limited resources to create something magical and we will show you a Nigerian. Nigeria’s industrial city, Aba has yet again invented an electric tricycle popularly known as Keke. A look at the pictures put up by @obibc on Twitter, reveals that the electric tricycle does not require fuel and has “zero carbon emission”. Don’t you think it is about time Nigeria deliberately invest and fund startups in cities that have the potential to make Nigeria a developed nation?
