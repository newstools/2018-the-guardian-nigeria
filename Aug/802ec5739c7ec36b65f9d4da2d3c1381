 Rauf Aregbesola, Governor State of Osun.  While flagging off the rehabilitation, Aregbesola said his administration had delivered on the electoral promises made to the people in all aspects of life, particularly in the area of infrastructure, where the largest chunk ‎of the state’s resources were spent on. The new phase coming under the Osun Rural Access and Mobility Project (RAMP II), took place in both Oragun and Oke Ila respectively. The project is jointly financed by the World ‎Bank and the French Development Agency. Aregbesola attributed the giant strides recorded by his administration to his commitment to modernise the state and uplift the standard of living of the people in the state. The National Coordinator of RAMP, Ubandoma Ularamu, commended the state for prompt payment of its counterpart fund. Ularamu said a total of 522.10km of rural roads and 26 river crossings (bridges) are being constructed and rehabilitated all over the state. ‎He expressed confidence in the ability of the state’s infrastructural projects to turn around the economic fortune of the state and by extension make life more abundant, comfortable and worthy of living for all. In his remarks, the State Project Coordinator of Osun Rural Access and Mobility Project, Adelere Oriolowo, said Osun RAMP has performed beyond the expected target during the execution of the first phase of project implementation.
