attends the 2016 BET Awards at the Microsoft Theater on June 26, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. It may seem as though the fight between Nigerian rapper, Falz and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) is just getting started as just recently the viral hit song “This is Nigeria” was fined after being aired on a radio station. Here’s what Falz had to say in an interview with Punch: “There is absolutely nothing vulgar about the song and I think it is ridiculous that the National Broadcasting Commission singled out the least vulgar line in the song and ascribed it to be the reason they banned the song. It is a very simple and clean song. The only thing is that I was very blunt about the way I talk about things. I do not know maybe some messages in the song hit them and that is the real reason they banned the song. The line was, ‘This is Nigeria, look how we living now. Everybody be criminal.’ If they ban this song, then I do not understand them because that song is definitely not a vulgar song. I do not know if the fact that some group wanted me to retract the song is linked with this new development but I know that there were a lot of messages in the song and it is hitting a lot of people in the wrong places and that is what is making them react in that manner. However, there was absolutely no basis for the NBC to ban that song.” Falz has decided to write to NBC through his lawyers to find out what is really going on and find out the reason behind the ban, “I could ask them to lift it if need be and if they do not adhere to my request, I might have to seek legal redress” he said.
