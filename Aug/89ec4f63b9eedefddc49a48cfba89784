 PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan  The statement is coming after the party rejected the result of the by-elections held on Saturday in Bauchi, Kogi and Katsina. “The PDP has particularly reviewed the rigging of Edo state governorship election in 2016, the blatant rigging of July 14, 2018, Ekiti state governorship election and the last Saturday’s federal constituency bye-elections in Bauchi, Katsina and Kogi states,” Kola Ologbondiyan PDP spokesman said in a statement. “Now that it has become manifest to Nigerians and all parties that the APC is only interested in rigging elections brazenly, it will henceforth contend with APC, head to head, means to means, scheme to scheme, shenanigan for shenanigan, in all ramifications and magnitude, to discomfit them in all coming elections in the country” Ologbondiyan added. The opposition party, therefore, vowed to “never again allow the APC and its Federal Government to continue to use foul means to usurp power as it has done in the past and merely ask the PDP to go to court. Never!”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
