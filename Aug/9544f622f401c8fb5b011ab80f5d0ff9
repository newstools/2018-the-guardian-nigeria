The Nigerian police yesterday urged Nigerians to join the partnership to reform and reposition the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) to conform to international best practice. The call was made at the event co-hosted with pop music star, Korede Bello, which scores of youths and senior officers of the Nigeria police attended. According to the representative of the Inspector General of police at the event, AIG in charge of Zone 2, Ibrahim Adamu, the event would further strengthen the communication between the police and the public. “We are happy with this partnership. The police is not a perfect organization, we would continue to communicate with members of the public to strengthen the force.” He reminded the audience that four policemen attached to SARS were dismissed few weeks ago by his office, urging Nigerians to continue to report irrational treatments by the plain-clothed outfit. According to him, “no father would be happy to charge his own child to court, but I did it few weeks ago. It was not easy, but I dismissed four officers from SARS for the crimes they committed and I did not stop at that, I charged them to court. We are not treating the excesses of SARS personnel with kid gloves. We need the support of Nigerians to address the challenges.” The event is an initiative of Korede Bello, aimed at ensuring Police Accountability after some Nigerians staged a nationwide protest to end the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, (SARS), a department of the Nigeria Police Force, that has been accused of recklessness and brutality against Nigerians. Police image-maker, Jimoh Moshood, who was at the event, commended the Korede Bello Initiative for Police Accountability reassured Nigerians that the reform of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad would soon yield positive results.
