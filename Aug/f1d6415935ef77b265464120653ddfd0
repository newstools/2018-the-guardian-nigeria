Muslim Ummah of South West Nigeria (MUSWEN), recently celebrated its 10th anniversary amid accolades.Indeed,  the umbrella body of Muslims in South West Nigeria was proud of its numerous milestones including the decade of unity, peace and progress of Muslims in the region. President, MUSWEN,  Alhaji Sakariyau Bablola, said the group had “in the past 10years provided leadership for and helped enhance peace and unity amongst stakeholders in the region. Besides,  the body has taken genuine steps that have set the Ummah in the region on the path of development and progress “. Babalola however appreciated those that contributed to the feat,  assuring a better future for the body and entire Muslim community in the region. Executive Secretary,  MUSWEN, Prof Dawud Noibi,  said: “The vision of MUSWEN is to serve as a united and effective voice for Muslims in the region under a strong,  veritable and collective leadership. The overall aim is to raise the profile of the Muslims in this part of the country “. Noibi bemoaned the marginalisation of Muslims in the region in the area of education and socio -political matters while alleging that the media paints wrong perceptions about the religion. “As a result,  Muslims of the region,  have for a long time been short -changed in many ways. Despite our large proportion in the population,  we are marginalised by successive governments both in educational and in socio-political matters. The ethnic -based organizations that emerged in the region have purportedly spoken for the entire region without consultations whatsoever with Muslims. On many occasions the stance of these organisations on issues at hand were detrimental to the image and welfare of Muslims. “The media too, both national and foreign seem to have adopted that wrong understanding. “ he stated. On the 2019 elections,  Noibi enjoined Muslims to obtain their Permanent Voters Card (PVC)  in other to exercise their franchise. “Our people must also be adequately educated about the need to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner before,  during and after  the elections  Muslims must resist the temptation to partake in any form of electoral malpractice.  We must all be guided by pristine Islamic values at all times. “In the same vein, all Muslim candidates must ensure that they distinguish themselves as men and women of unblemished character and attestable competence.  They must be ready to serve the nation in whatever capacity conscientiously and responsibly.  “They must be legacy driven and work for the good of all. They must shun corruption and all acts that have hindered the nation’s progress.  They must be ready to serve as good ambassadors of Islam. “ he said.
