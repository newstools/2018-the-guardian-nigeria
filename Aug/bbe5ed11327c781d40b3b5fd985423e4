Chelsea have competed the signing of Kepa Arrizabalaga from Athletic Bilbao. The 23-year-old Spaniard signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge for a record 80 million euro (£71.6 million, $92 million) fee for a goalkeeper. ‘It’s a very important decision for me, for my career, and also for my personal life,” Arrizabalaga told ChelseaFC ‘So many things attracted me to the club, all the titles the club has won, the other players, the city, the English Premier League. It’s an accumulation of things, and I am very glad Chelsea has decided to trust me and to take me in as well.’ Earlier on Wednesday, Bilbao confirmed that Arrizabalaga had paid his buyout clause at the league’s headquarters in Madrid to free him from his contract with Athletic. Arrizabalaga has played 53 times in La Liga for Bilbao over the last two seasons, and made his international debut in a 5-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in November 2017. He was also in the Spain squad for the World Cup in Russia as back-up to David De Gea, but has yet to make his competitive debut for Spain.
