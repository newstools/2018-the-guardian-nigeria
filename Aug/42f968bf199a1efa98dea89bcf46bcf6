The party, in a statement by its Acting National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yekini Nabena, said the decision was aimed at availing Nigerians who are in support of the change agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration the opportunity to join the party. He said the exercise would include both fresh registration and revalidation of existing membership for the purposes of issuance of the party’s permanent membership card. He, hereby, urged the party’s teeming supporters and members to take advantage of the exercise to be officially registered into the membership ranks of the party.
