PHOTO: Chinatopix US President Donald Trump is now considering a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese imports, more than the 10 percent previously touted, reports said Tuesday. The US imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products earlier this month, with plans to add another $16 billion of imports on Tuesday. Trump initially threatened to levy 10 percent on an additional $200 billion but that figure may now rise to 25 percent, sources told the Washington Post and Bloomberg. It would represent a ramping up of pressure over Washingtonâ€™s trade standoff with Beijing. Markets were however steady on Tuesday, given a boost by hopes for new negotiations. In 2017, the United States had a $376 billion trade deficit with China, which it is keen to cut. Trump recently threatened to slap punitive tariffs on all Chinese imports, which accounted for more than $500 billion last year.
