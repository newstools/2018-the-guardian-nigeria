The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Congress has fixed a new date for the federation’s elective congress. The poll is slated to hold on September 22, 2018. The decision was part of the resolution taken by the Congress during its extraordinary General Assembly in Benin City, Edo state, last week. The initial date of the election was September 29, but it collides with the Confederation of African Football, CAF, congress to be held in Morocco. The change in the date has reportedly given rise to further speculation that a conspiracy is brewing over the resumed hearing of the case brought against the NFF board by factional president, Chris Giwa. A Federal High Court sitting in Jos had on 1 August 2018, adjourned the case until September 2. This has been interpreted as a way of ensuring Giwa’s claim to the leadership of the federation, would elapse and be overtaken by next election.
