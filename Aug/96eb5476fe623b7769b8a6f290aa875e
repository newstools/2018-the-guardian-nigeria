While we wait for Buhari & Osinbajo to send their sympathies, permit me to say that I'm less proud that it took a #CNN tweet to make you respond. 2nd step however is to honour Joseph Blankson & provide for his young family. https://t.co/YNfGqZnOf5 — The Jonathanian (@The_Jonathanian) August 6, 2018  36 year old Joseph Blankson gave his life for those passengers. 13 times he swam to rescue. 13 times he saved a soul. At the 14 attempt, God Almighty gave him eternal rest. May his legacy of selfless service continue to inspire us. https://t.co/xVGWg9BjFn — Amara Nwankpa (@Nwankpa_A) August 6, 2018  Joseph Blankson reward will be so huge in the afterlife n beyond.
