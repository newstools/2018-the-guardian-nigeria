 miscreants  The enforcement operation was carried out based on complaints by different communities around the area. The team also demolished 98 illegal shanties built on drainage alignment and road setbacks. Chairman of the agency, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, who led the enforcement team, disclosed that 210 arrested miscreants and street urchins were those recently dislodged by the agency along the railway track behind abattoir at Agege. He disclosed that the miscreants terrorised the communities day and night by robbing them of their valuables such as phones, wallets and jewelry. “It was an eye-sore as these dislodged miscreants and street urchins were freely smoking and selling Indian hemp around residential premises where you have underage pupils,” he said. Egbeyemi added that the demolished shanties and containarised shops within abattoir and adjourning streets, aside being on the landscape and harbouring criminals, also contribute to the poor environment and safety issues in and around Agege. He commended Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for the upgrade of abattoirs across the state with needed infrastructural facilities, particularly Agege Abattoir. The chairman also confirmed that over 125 motorcycles plying restricted routes around these communities were impounded by the agency during the enforcement operation, while the arrested miscreants and street urchins were immediately charged to court on the directive of the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Edgal Imohimi. He mentioned areas where the dislodged miscreants carried out their nefarious activities by erecting illegal shanties. They include Pipeline-way, Agric Road, Olaofe Road and Mofoladayo Drive. Egbeyemi implored community leaders (CDAs) to be watchful of their immediate environment. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
