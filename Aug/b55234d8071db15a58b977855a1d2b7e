The Champions League draw was made in Monaco and pits holders Real Madrid against last year’s semi-finalists, Roma.<br />Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/ Manchester United have been handed a difficult group in the UEFA Champions League draw that was completed on Thursday evening. Jose Mourinho’s men were placed in tricky group alongside Juventus, Valencia and Young Boys. Crisitiano Ronaldo will be playing for his new side Juventus against one of his old clubs Manchester United. The Portuguese forward was awarded the UEFA forward of the year but he missed out on the Player of the Year award to his former teammate Luka Modric. Tottenham Hotspurs will have their work cut out against Barcelona and Inter Milan with PSV Eindhoven completing the group. Last season’s finalist Liverpool were grouped alongside French Champions Paris Saint German, Italian side Napoli and Red Star Belgrade in Group C. Premier League champions Manchester City were placed in the same group as Shakhtar Donetsk like last season. Group F also features German side Hoffenheim and French club Lyon. Defending champions Real Madrid will battle Roma, CSKA Moskva and Viktoria Plzeň as they play their first Champions League in nine years without Portuguese forward Ronaldo. Europa League winners Atletico Madrid are in Group A with Dortmund, Monaco and Club Brugge. Draw in full Group A
