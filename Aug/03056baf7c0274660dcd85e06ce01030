He said the issue of community matters shouldn’t be played as politics and any community leader that wants to grow and build a strong, virile community must shun politics and exhibit fairness and equity in all their dealings. “Community where facts are not being embraced and matters are seen through the eye of politics, that community will remain retarded. Many communities have had their growth and capacity to develop delayed when its leaders delve into politics which often times comes with a lot of distraction. The role of community leaders is to seek for the welfare, security and overall development of their community”. He further applauded the newly installed cabinet members, urging them to work together as a team and render their best to develop the community. Also, the Baale of Ajara Lopo, Tovieyi 1 explained that the community was divided into zones and the cabinet and elders committee were chosen from each zone for easy administration of the community. The elated Baale promised to work towards peace and unity in the community, which is the major target governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwumi Ambode.
