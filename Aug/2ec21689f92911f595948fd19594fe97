Worried by the present academic and infrasctructural state of their alma mater, King’s College Old Boys Association (KCOBA), has organised a symposium to tactically address the issues threatening the productive existence of the college. The old boys in their respective remarks at the summit tagged, ‘The Kings College Conundrum: Where Do We Go From Here,’ pointed out that the creation of the college in1909 was undoubtedly one of the momentous events in the development of modern education in Nigeria, but sustaining the dreams of the founding fathers is the utmost. President of KCOBA, Kashim Imam, explained that the objectives of the summit is to deliberate on how to restore the past glory of the college and place it in its distinguished position among the nation’s secondary schools. Imam, who hinted that the colonial authorities paid specific attention to the development of Kings College in the first half-century of its establishment, added that they were meticulous in ensuring that extremely high standard was maintained. Highlighting the importance of reflecting on the trajectory growth of King’s College Lagos; evaluating the factors that have influenced its development over the years; and establishing the challenges presently confronting it, the president called for proper articulation of a framework for its development in subsequent years. He said, “The downward slide in the performance of King’s College Lagos most certainly demands urgent attention. The problems currently faced by the college include inadequate funding, weak administration, indiscipline, inadequacy of teachers both in numbers and quality, overpopulation, the structure of the curriculum and the current location of the school among other issues. These challenges must occupy the attention of all those interested in the restoration of the fortunes of the college. “The nature and complexity of the problem suggest the need to consider a wide variety of options, including a temporary or permanent closure of the school as a potentially viable alternative designed to safeguard its reputation. There is a responsibility, therefore, on the part of the stakeholders to seek a solution to the challenges that confront the continued existence of the school and its legacy, as well as articulate essential elements of a strategic and policy framework to enable progress and continuing development of the college.” Imam further added that the decline has been a source of concern to many who have followed the progress of the school, adding that the association would provide a forum to present practical solutions to the challenges of King’s College with a view to preserving its ethos, standards and reputation both locally and internationally.
