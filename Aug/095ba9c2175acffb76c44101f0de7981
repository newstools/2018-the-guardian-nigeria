There are many ways to prepare egusi soup and there are many other seeds called thickeners combined with egusi to make a delicious soup.
The akpurakpu egusi or Ofe Achara is a traditional recipe that is peculiar to natives of Abia state. The process requires makingÂ egusi into disc-like shapes using a mixture of predominantly egusi, and other ingredients, then adding it to the soup. This makes for a very rich soup filled with edible treats. Egusi soup with Akpurakpu egusi. Photo: African Dishes
