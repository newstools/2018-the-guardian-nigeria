Now every local government in Nigeria has N-Power graduate.” Osinbajo assured Nigerians that the Buhari administration remains committed to supporting traders to artisans and mechanics. He listed other interventions as Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP), a micro-credit scheme for market women and TraderMoni for petty traders, of which at least 100,000 would benefit in Lagos and two million traders across the country.
