Nowadays, food-manufacturing companies have basically stripped away our freedom to opt out of eating GMO foods. All you have to do is walk into a supermarket and you are hit with a wide selection of attractive looking GMO foods including chips, baked goods, cereals, meats, poultry, and even some supposedly healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables. GMOs, or Genetically Modified Organisms, are foods whose genetic material has been altered from its naturally occurring state. In other words, genes from other sources have been introduced into these foods. The intended uses of GMOs on crops were to provide them with the ability to abstain direct herbicide application and offer greater yields. Biotechnology companies responsible for manufacturing genetically engineered foods claim that it will help with increased supply of food which will help eradicate hunger, especially in countries such as Nigeria. This, however, hasn’t been the case. Instead, research has connected GMOs with various health problems and substantial environmental damage. Numerous studies have been done on animals and the health implications of these foods on these animals are unfavourable. The health risks include infertility, immune problems, accelerated aging, infant mortality, problematic insulin regulation, weight gain, inability to lose weight, stomach problems, reduction in digestive enzymes, liver toxicity, allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, chronic inflammation, cancer etc. So the question is, how do we stay healthy? How can we undo the damage GMOs have caused and continue to inflict on our bodies?  The single most effective way to not participate in the GMO experiment is to avoid them! Unfortunately, there is a widespread application of many of the top GMO-ridden crops (such as corn, soy, and canola) and we use them everyday without even knowing. For example, the use of corn is so widely diversified; as a filler, emulsifier, sweetener, preservative, adhesive, and much more. Different names for corn include: Corn syrup, High fructose corn syrup, Corn starch, Modified food starch, Corn meal, Vegetable oil, Corn flour etc. If you read your food labels, I’m sure you have come across these ingredients a few times. So you see, it is nearly impossible to avoid all exposure to these experimental food-like substances. However, there are a few things we can do to counteract the damage done. Detoxification is a way for the body to get rid of unwanted materials or toxins. It ensures all of the bodily functions are working optimally and this is done through the channels of elimination such as skin, colon, blood, kidneys, liver etc along with various strategies to facilitate and encourage the process of cleaning out these GMOs from the body. Here are five ways to detoxify from GMO: 1. Eating an organic, plant-based diet is the number one way to cleanse your system, while also limiting your exposure to toxins altogether. Foods high in vitamin C, fiber, minerals, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory properties are the most beneficial for both detoxification and healing from GMO consumption. Foods like Spinach, curcumin, avocado, lemon, green tea, ginger, broccoli etc are all great. 2. Increase Fiber Intake: Fiber works by “grabbing” the toxins within your digestive tract and facilitating them out of your system through elimination important for the prevention of toxic build up as well as clearing the system from previous toxin exposure.
3. Choose to eat home-cooked foods. That way you are sure of eating wholesome nutritious meals. Avoid consuming packaged foods. Around 80 per cent of these foods and snacks contain GMO. 4.Incorporate Probiotics: They produce substances that help to balance the gut’s microbiome by promoting healthy bacteria and hindering harmful bacterial growth. Supplementing with probiotic-rich foods is a great way to reestablish the gut’s bacterial balance after exposure to GMOs. Including these foods into your diet works to fight the damage GMOs may have caused as well as preventing future toxic build up. 5. Sweat it Out with exercise! The benefits of exercise are plentiful. They range anywhere from heart health and bone health to mood management. One of the most important components of exercise is a by-product of the physical activity which is sweating. Sweating is one of the main ways that the body releases toxins. Sauna and steam therapy, as well as getting a massage are all methods that promote detoxification as well. The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) has warned that GMO foods are inherently unsafe and have asked all doctors to advise their patients to avoid GM foods. The associated health risks that come with the foods make them harmful and dangerous, especially with long term exposure. Following these tips provided would help effectively clear GMO foods out of your system and promote healing and optimal health.
