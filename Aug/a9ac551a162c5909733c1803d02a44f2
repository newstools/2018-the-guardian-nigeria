Several research studies have shown that black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related issue than white women. While there is access to quality healthcare in some developed countries, the same cannot be said of Nigeria. With 87 million of her citizens living in abject poverty, the country accounts for 14% of the world’s maternal mortality deaths (the highest in West and Central Africa). Out of this number, the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that only 40% of women in low-income countries visit antenatal care units. Yet, the average Nigerian family has an average of 5.5 children and continues to give birth due to societal pressure. In March this year, Bill Gates, founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, named Nigeria as one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth.

According to RedCare, this means that “only N1,888 will be spent on each citizen the whole year.” These statistics show that the argument that a woman and her child’s health is important is defeated by the Nigerian condition which continues to fight against the basic means of survival. One must question if Nigeria is ready to improve her healthcare system to come to par with hospitals in various developed countries. After all, some developed countries’ health policies actively cover insurance policies for her citizens, including immigrants. With the continuous out troop of her qualified doctors to seek for better lives, this begs the question: how does Nigeria want to grapple itself from this threatening problem?
