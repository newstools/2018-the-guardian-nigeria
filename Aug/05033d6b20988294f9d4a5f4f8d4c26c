Having toured other major cities in Nigeria, the Legend Real Deal Experience is returning to Lagos, and fans are in for a great time, as it promises to be a remarkable event. The show, which holds on August 25, at the Abesan Mini Stadium, Abesan Estate, Ipaja, is an initiative that has spanned several years and visited major cities and towns across Nigeria. The event, which is the brand’s flagship consumer engagement activity, has become a core staple of the brand and is often revered for its perfect blend of fun, music, dance, laughter and games. These events are also characterised by musical performances by some of Nigeria’s favorite artistes on popular demand. This edition will be headlined by fast-rising street pop sensations, Mr. Real and Slimcase. Together, they will be leading the enthusiastic Lagos crowd on a dancing spree. Mr. Real, who is well known for his 2017 hit, Legbegbe, and one of the pioneer promoters of the rave of the moment dance Shaku Shaku, will be entertaining the fans with some of his hit songs. Slimcase, an equally passionate representation of the latest street dance in body and in music style, will be gracing the stage with his popular hit features such as Shepeteri, Diet, Oshozondi and Shawashawa, as well as his slangs, which within the last few months have been accepted into the regular street lingo. The duo, who have featured in collaborations on other hit songs from DBanj and Mr. Eazi are expected to get fans giddy with excitement and leave them with a refreshing, unforgettable experience.The show will be co-hosted by Big Brother Naija’s Ifu Ennada, who is known to be on her A-game in compering, giving the brilliant dozes she dished out on the BBNaija show. Also billed to host is comedian De Don. Speaking on the forthcoming show, the Portfolio Manager- Mainstream Lager & Stout Brands, Emmanuel Agu, stated that “Everything has been put in place to ensure that fans across Lagos have a time of their lives at the event. He also described it as part of Legend’s unwavering commitment to its consumers, an avenue to better interact with the brand’s consumers and a promise of continued entertainment being fulfilled.” On the artistes performing for the night, he stated that it will be two times the fun as Slimcase and Mr. Real are up to the task of lighting up the stage and giving ovation-worthy performances. “Giving how accepted these two artistes have become in the last one year, there is no doubt that the fans would be excited to have them and be fully entertained by them, he added.”Apart from the headlining acts, there will also be electrifying live performances by other acts from across Lagos.
