Tiwa Savage performed for thousands of adoring, screaming fans and supporters at her sold-out #TheSavageTour concert held at Indigo at the O2. The Savage Tour #TheSavageTour had been highly anticipated for months and surpassed expectations with the bill of artistes. In addition to Tiwa Savage, who cemented her place in history as being the first female Afrobeats artiste to headline the O2 stadium, fans were thrilled and excited as Alternate Sound, the official band, brought to life the performances of Don Jazzy, Dr. Sid, Korede Bello, Awilo, WSTRN, and Mystro. People present were especially moved by Tiwa Savageâ€™s tributes to African Icons such as Mandela and Kofi Annan. See pictures below:
