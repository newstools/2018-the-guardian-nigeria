This past weekend, the VS Class auditions in Benin revealed a massive hip-hop community with talented Rappers from within the city and neighbouring cities converging on the Gold Wing of the Randheki Royal Hotel for an opportunity to be heard. VS Class Judges; Hip hop connoisseur Andy Bello, ace rapper, Vector the Viper; Celebrity Hypeman, Jimmie; and VS Class Alumnus, Phlow, had a difficult task choosing from the best MCs Benin had to offer. At the end of the auditions, 5 MCs were selected to move on to the next stage. The Lagos live auditions present the last chance for the “best of the best” to step up to the mic and show the judges what they are made of. Auditions will take place at Koga Studios, No 2 Bolaji Street by Mobil Bus stop, Oregun Road. Alausa, Ikeja. Registrations are still open via the official website This opportunity is not limited to emerging rappers domiciled in Lagos alone, but for anyone who believes they have what it takes to be the new face of Rap in Nigeria.
