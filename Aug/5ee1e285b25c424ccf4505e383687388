 Director General of the National Youth Services Corp, Brigadier General Suleiman Zakari Kazaure  Kazaure disclosed this in Jalingo when he paid a working visit to the orientation camp in Taraba to interact with corps members. “As graduates, you should avoid all social vices especially drug abuse, which is one of the leading causes of problems in the society today. “Lead other youth in shunning the menace and other anti-social behaviour for a better country. “You also have to be security conscious, and do not move alone in the course of your service to the nation,” he said. Kazaure expressed optimism that the monthly allowances of corps members would soon be reviewed upward to enhance their well-being in their service year. The DG assured the corps members of adequate security during the 2019 general elections, saying that a memorandum of understanding had been signed between the scheme and stakeholders to that effect. Earlier, Mrs Florence Yaakugh, the Taraba Coordinator of the scheme, had told the DG that the 1,807 Batch B corps members in the camp were very disciplined in the course of the orientation. She highlighted the achievements of the state office, including renovation of some of the buildings destroyed by the recent windstorm in the state. Yaakugh informed the DG that the major challenge facing the camp was that of low perimeter fencing which collapsed easily whenever there was wind. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the DG presented gifts to the band and dancers, among others, for their outstanding performance during the visit.
