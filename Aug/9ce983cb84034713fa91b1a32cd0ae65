 Members of the community at The Guardian head-office… yesterday.

The aggrieved residents demanded that prepaid meters be provided for the entire community. Secretary General of community, Mr. Kayode Ogunbola, said the community had written series of letters to the company stating their plight but it has yielded no result. He said: “We are tired of crazy bills because we pay for light we did not consume. For more than one week now, we have been in darkness as EKEDC has disconnected us completely. We need prepaid meters to enable us to pay for only what we consume.” Mrs. Grace Olajide also lamented the high estimated bills the community always receives. She said: “The bills they bring to us for the past two months have been unbearable. They charge us as high as N7,500 and the light is not constant. For past one week now, they have refused to give us light. We went to EKEDC headquarters to plead with the managing director that our bills should come down to N5,000 because that is the money we can afford, but the MD’s response was that we should go back home to pay the current charges, else they will seize light from our community.” One of the protesters, Mr. Odunlami said: “I pay up to N6,000 each month for light, which I don’t use or enjoy because of the nature of my job. I leave home early in the morning and come back late at night.” At the time of compiling of this report, efforts made to speak with officials of EKEDC proved abortive as they refused to pick calls put across to them.
