 Development Bank of Nigeria Plc  A statement from DBN said: “This is a milestone achievement and I am particularly happy that we are getting a lot of traction on our lending activities with LAPO. The collaboration is encouraging because they were among the first three microfinance banks we commenced our initial pilot lending with in November 2017.”  We are happy with the partnership and we will continue to work with DBN to ensure that collectively, we are able provide the much-needed funding that the MSMEs require to flourish.” “According to the IFC MSME Finance Gap Report in 2017, there are over 37 million MSMEs contributing to over 50 per cent of Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP). However, less than five per cent of these businesses have access to credit in the financial system. “DBN’s entrance and its interventions are therefore, relevant and timely. They will reverse this trend by making it easier for MSMEs to access financing to build and expand their businesses and unleash the power of the MSME business segment to drive national economic development.
