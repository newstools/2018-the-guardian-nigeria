Nearly every fashionable person, or someone who has a little idea of styling, has a white shirt in their wardrobe. This why these tips are necessary. Many would agree that the colour white makes you glow. So, why not style up your white shirts with these tips! While this may seem like the regular combination, you can also tuck in your shirt into a pair of either fitted or mum jeans. To turn up the style, add a pair of court shoes or any fitting shoes, and you’ll not only feel beautiful but confident. With a nice tailored jacket, you can never go wrong. For a formal meeting, style your regular white shirt, whether tucked in or not, with a well-tailored coat or jacket of your choice. Nothing says elegant as wearing a properly tucked in white shirt on a nicely fitted high-waist skirt. Steal the spotlight at the office with this simple yet stunning look. Also, don’t forget to throw in a great pair of shoes. For a more casual look, style up your white shirts with nice trainers. Contrary to popular belief, white shirts don’t always have to be for formal meetings. While a plain white shirt may seem boring if not properly styled, you can glam up your look with statement fashion accessories. Throw on a bold statement necklace, ones with a collar necklace or a pendant on a long chain. You can also throw on a bright pair of shoes or leopard print bag to pop.
