PHOTO:  LUCY LADIDI ELUKPO  Saraki’s accusation came after operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) laid a siege to the National Assembly complex and prevented lawmakers from entering into their chambers. But the Nigerian Government denied having foreknowledge of the act. Saraki told a world press conference in Abuja noted that under no circumstances should the government security operatives restrict lawmakers from accessing the National Assembly complex on Tuesday. “The National Assembly, the seat of democracy in Nigeria, was under lockdown. In no circumstances should this have happened. And we as a nation reaped the bitter fruits instantaneously, as evident in media images relayed around the world, images that shame us as a democratic nation.” Saraki said. The senate president said the siege “was an act of cowardice by those seeking to carry out an illegal impeachment of the leadership of the Senate in flagrant disregard of the law. People who seek control at all costs, by whatever means, never minding the injury to democratic norms.” Saraki applaud Nigerians for voicing out against war on the nation’s democracy through “act of gangsterism using instruments of state such as the DSS” by the federal government. “This is a country where so much is expected of us, so many rungs of the ladder that we are supposed to have ascended as a nation. Instead, we are wallowing in impunity and illegal show of force, all of which retard our progress.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
