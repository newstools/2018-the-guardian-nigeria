Access Bank As part of its strategy to deepen its commitment towards providing easy banking experience to customers, Access Bank Plc has leveraged on the pervasive WhatsApp social media platform to bring its banking relationship managers closer to its customers. Through new development, customers can now use the bank’s market leading and feature rich mobile App, Access Mobile, available on IOS and Android platforms, to effortlessly engage their relationship manager in the provision of customised and responsive banking services, using the WhatsApp messaging platform. The service, which is first of its kind in the Nigerian banking sector and launched in April 2018, according to Access Bank GMD/CEO, Herbert Wigwe, is in line with the bank’s vision to change the face of banking on the continent by leveraging innovation and technology, while ensuring that customers are provided with the opportunity to enjoy ease of access and engagement in their banking transactions and maximise their financial opportunities. He stressed that the three core values — speed, service, and security – upon which the Bank remains steadfast, requires a high level of innovation and thought leadership which again is demonstrated with this WhatsApp feature. “Driving customer intimacy and providing engaging and convenient access to financial services across all channels remain a key focus area for us and we will continue to drive and implement solutions to provide a best in class service for our customers,” Wigwe stated. Wigwe explained that the WhatsApp feature is the latest in the series of innovative features championed by Access Bank, adding that several of these efforts, especially in the areas of customer experience, personal banking and sustainability have fetched recognitions and awards from local and international platforms, the most recent being the Karlsruhe and Euromoney awards.
