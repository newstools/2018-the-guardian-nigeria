Waripamo-Owei Dudafa A Federal High Court in Lagos, yesterday dismissed the no case submission filed by former president Goodluck Jonathan’s aide, Waripamo-Owei Dudafa. The court, presided over by Justice Mohammed Idris, told the accused to open his defence against the alleged N1.6 billion financial crime charges leveled against him and his co-accused by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). While ruling on the no case submission applications filed by the defendants, Justice Idris ordered Dudafa, who was Special Assistant to President Jonathan on Domestic Affairs and his co-accused, Iwejuo Joseph Nna, to open their defence on the allegations. “The prosecution in this case called witnesses and tendered exhibits. The defendants will need to explain the content of the exhibits. “At this stage, asking if the court will believe the exhibits is not allowed. I am of the view that the defendants have some explanations to make on the alleged crimes. The no case submission of the defendants is hereby refused,” the judge held. The defendants in their applications had urged the court to discharge and acquit them of the alleged fraud, saying they were not complicit in the purported crime. The anti-graft agency had arraigned them before Justice Idris on 23 count charges of conspiracy to conceal proceeds of crime amounting to over N1.6 billion on June 11, 2013. Following the dismissal of their no case submission and by consent of the prosecutor, as well as the defence counsel, the matter was adjourned till August 20, 2018 to allow the defendants open their defence.
