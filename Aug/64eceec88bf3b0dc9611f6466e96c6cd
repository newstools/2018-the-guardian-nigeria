 Dr. Elishama Ideh  She particularly alleged that the party had been hijacked by a highly placed non-registered member keen on vying for the presidency in next year’s election.The aspirant assured that she would surely pursue her presidential ambition in next year’s general elections on the platform of any of the registered political parties in the country, but declined to disclose the identity of the person behind the alleged hijack of the ANN structure. According to her: “As things stand at the moment, the party structure has been hijacked by a certain character. Interestingly, up till now, this character has not declared his interest in running. “It is evident that there is no level playing field for aspirants on the platform of the party and we are being sidelined in the agreed processes. “To this end, I will not be participating in the party’s convention scheduled for tomorrow (today).”Reiterating her desire to enthrone a new order in the nation devoid of the tainted and corrupt tendencies of the past, she noted that she remained committed to her seven-point agenda, which includes security, law and order, human capital development, great, affordable and accessible healthcare and industrialisation and infrastructure.
