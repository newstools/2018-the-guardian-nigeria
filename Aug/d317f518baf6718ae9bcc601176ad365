Fans will remember Johnny Depp and his brilliant role as Jack Sparrow in the film Pirates of the Caribbean. The Golden Globe award winner was set to release a film about the famous rap artist Notorious BIG who was murdered shortly after Tupac. The film was scheduled to be released on September 7th 2018 and has been cancelled and no further update has been given. This decision came after he was sued by one of the crew members in July for assault. His ex-wife Amber Heard had also accused him of assault although he denied. This has attracted a lot of bad press for the production hence the decision to pull it. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-712278 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush.jpg 980w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush-487x325.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush-974x649.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush-640x426.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnny-Depp-photo-ScreenCrush-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The film was based on a novel titled LAByrinth authored by Randall Sullivan.
