Heineken Lagos Fashion Week in partnership with Style House Files, Fets Wallet, Fayrouz, and Canon launches the first ever Green Access Competition and 2018 Visual Makers Fellowship. Green Access is a competition that aims to raise awareness amongst Nigerian students of the need to make sustainable choices in the Nigerian fashion industry and simultaneously, discover raw fashion talent. <img class="size-medium wp-image-714306 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-1-1-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="598" /> Sustainability is at the forefront of global fashion conversations. More and more fashion enterprises are transforming their business models and embracing strategies towards more environmentally, socially and ethically conscious production. Locally, designers such as Emmy Kasbit, Maki Oh, Zashadu, Nkwo, and JZO utilize and source traditionally crafted materials, in an effort to support artisan craft, grow economic status and sustain generational craftsmanship of indigenous fabrics such as Adire, Akwete, Aso Oke, and Leather. <img class="size-medium wp-image-714308 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-974x974.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1-600x600.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /> “We are committed to the Sustainable Development Goals and plan to utilize the Lagos Fashion Week platform to facilitate dialogues and implement initiatives within the African fashion industry.
