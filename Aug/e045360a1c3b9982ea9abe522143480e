 Fish production  Fish farmers in Nigeria have raised the alarm that frozen fish importers and officials in the Department of Fishery, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, are sabotaging efforts to rev up local fish production.The Catfish and Allied Fish Farmers Association of Nigeria (CAFFAN), through its National President, Mr Rotimi Oloye, disclosed this to The Guardian in an exclusive.
 
He alleged that directors in the Fishery Department are influenced by importers of frozen fish to increase quotas of fish importation.He said: “Let me tell you another happening in Nigeria that prevents policies from working. Data that we use are concocted. When the ministry tries to work out the quantity of fish we consume in Nigeria, they use 180 million people to multiply15 kilogrammes of fish eaten by an average Nigerian, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), to arrive at a number of tonnes of fish consumed locally.	 
 
“They will then work out a figure as the locally produced quantity per annum. The deficit has to be imported. They now use the deficit figure to pressurize the Federal Government to grant approval for importation of frozen fish,” he said.	He accused the department of releasing fictitious figures for selfish ends, saying by his position as President of CAFFAN, nobody in the Ministry of Agriculture has ever collected production figures from him or other members, yet they release fake production figures.
