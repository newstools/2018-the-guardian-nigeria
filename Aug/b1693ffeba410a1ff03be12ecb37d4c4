Bukola Saraki Nigeria Senate President, Bukola Saraki on Thursday officially declared his intent to run for president in the 2019 general elections. “I hereby announce my intention to run for the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the coming General Elections in 2019 on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). I do so with the firm conviction that I have what it takes to secure inclusive growth for Nigeria and Nigerians,” Saraki said in a meeting with young political aspirants in Abuja. Saraki, who only defected back to People’s Democratic Party late July, on August 14 said he was considering running against Buhari in 2019. “I am consulting and actively considering it,” Saraki told Bloomberg News. On Wednesday, Saraki met with the erstwhile Nigeria president, Goodluck Jonathan and has also paid courtesy visits to former military presidents Ibrahim Babangida, Olusegun Obasanjo amongst other notable politicians across the country since his defection. However, to win the PDP ticket at the party’s primaries on Oct. 5 and 6, Saraki would need to beat another presidential aspirant, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who also defected from the APC last year and former Kano state governor, Rabi’u Kwankwaso, who on Wednesday declared his ambition in Abuja. Political pundits predict the battle for the PDP presidential ticket between this trio will be fierce. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
