 Acting NFF President, Chris Giwa  Nigeria has up till tomorrow to put its house in order if it must avoid sanctions arising from ongoing wrangling between the FIFA- recognised NFF’s President, Amaju Pinnick, and the Rufus Giwa-led group. Esin, who expressed disgust at the festering crisis, wondered what the incentives were when the next election into the Glass House is just next month. “For the sake of the country’s football, let these two parties wait till next month for the election. This crisis has been going on for too long and Nigeria’s interest is bigger than that of the individuals involved in this scuffle,” he said. Speaking on the decision of forward, Victor Moses to retire from the Super Eagles, the former junior international said the decision did not take him by surprise as many players did same in the past only to return later. “Several top players have done that after playing for their nations at other competitions. Lionel Messi of Argentina did the same only to return. The reason behind Moses’ swift decision may be due to his state of mind. The idea of not being able to cope with playing for club and country may be the reason. “Moses has done well for his fatherland; he tried his best. But this is where continuity comes in, and that is why we must always look out for replacement for these players. By now, we should have had players who would replace Moses, Mikel Obi and others. “The nation would definitely miss his services as a great winger, who did his best for his country. I believe there are players waiting by the side to take over from him,” he said. Etim, who is now a football agent, however, thanked Moses for the few years he played for the country saying: “I really thank Victor for his services to the country. We have always seen players retired and come back to the national team. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
