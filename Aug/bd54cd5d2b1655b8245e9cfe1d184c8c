The 24-year-old Croatia international arrives as part of a deal which sealed Thibaut Courtois’ move to Santiago Bernabéu. “I am really happy and excited to be here at Chelsea. It is an amazing feeling,” Kovacic told ChelseaFC I will try to do my best for this club. It is a new league for me, the beginning is always tough but I am sure the coach and my new team-mates will help me and I am looking forward to a great season.’ Chelsea’s report does not confirm if the Blues hold an option to buy the player permanently or not, but it is believed that no such clause has been added to the deal. Kovačić began his professional career with Dinamo Zagreb at the age of 16. He won two consecutive league titles, before joining Inter Milan in 2013. After the 2014–15 season, he moved to Real Madrid, where he has won the Champions League on three times. Kovačić represented the nation at the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.
