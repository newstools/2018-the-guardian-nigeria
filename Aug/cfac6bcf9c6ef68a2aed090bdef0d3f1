 Ambrose Ali University  While admitting that there’s a gap between the school and the corporate world, Ujuanbi said regular interface between old and new students would help in closing the gap existing between town and gown, and build their confidence.He said, “It is indeed an indisputable fact that there is a lot of difference between the outside world and what you would find in the universities, in order to close the gap, the alumni association encouraged members who are in the corporate world to have regular interface with students, training them on operational activities in the world of work and how best to transfer learning. This has been very impactful. It has helped in confidence building and curriculum development. Apart from building friendship and supporting the university to create platforms for networking among members, Ujuambi said the ultimate benefit for the young graduates would be the creation of employment opportunities, and mentorship for career development. “The vision of our university is to foster knowledge for the advancement of the society. The core activities of the alumni have been in tandem with the corporate vision of this institution; we have therefore used multiple approaches to maximize the quality of the students’ learning experience. As a result, we have vigorously mobilized members to support the infrastructural and human capacity development of the university through donations of books to the library, building of critical infrastructures as well as the provision of scholarships to indigent students. Ujuambi added, “There are several valuable ways you can give back to your alma-mater. Most times, cash donations to fund projects in the school appear to be most common. However, giving your time and talent to support the students are ways by which you can also give back to the school.
