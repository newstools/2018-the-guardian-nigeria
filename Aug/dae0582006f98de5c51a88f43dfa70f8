 President Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo.<br />Photo:Twitter/MBuhari  Speaking at media parley in Lagos yesterday, Martins said it was dangerous for the populace to remain nonchalant to the 2019 elections by not going out to vote otherwise, “wrong people would take advantage of the situation to foster wrong choices on the country.” He also urged Nigerians to critically probe the intention of all presidential aspirants currently mouthing restructuring as a slogan on the pretense they were committed to it. He also said it was time for Nigerians to ask questions from their representatives in the National Assembly on why they shot down the bill on local government autonomy if they were actually committed to restructuring. The group urged the Nigerian youths in particular to rally around President Buhari and his vice, for a second term on the condition that he would find a credible and committed youth he must hand over power to in 2023. The group also enjoined the Southeast region to support the incumbent administration for second term considering the massive projects it is currently executing in the region and the chances it would provide for the South after its tenure “instead of the desperation currently being demonstrated by some northern presidential aspirants.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
