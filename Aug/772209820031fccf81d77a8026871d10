Kurt Zouma has joined Everton on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. Zouma, 23, played at Stoke City last season on a loan from Chelsea. The Frenchman moved to Chelsea in 2014 from Saint-Étienne, where he made his debut as a 16-year-old. He joins Brazil midfielder Bernard, Barcelona trio Yerry Mina, Andre Gomes and Lucas Digne, Richarlison and Joao Virginia in arriving at Goodison in the summer transfer window. Everton were linked with the centre-back on transfer deadline day and reportedly agreed a deal but the deal only got completed today. Zouma has two caps for France. He will wear the number five shirt for Everton. He could be on line to make his debut for the Merseyside club, when they square up against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. Marco Silva will hope to better an eighth-place finish for Everton in the 2017-18 Premier League, with eyes on a return to European competition. Chelsea also on Friday announced the departure of Michy Batshuayi on a season-long loan to Valencia. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
