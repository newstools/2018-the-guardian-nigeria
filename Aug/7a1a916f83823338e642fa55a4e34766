 Journalists  Professional journalism stands on the foundation of truth according to journalism teacher; John Baptist Wasswa, who maintained that practitioners have a responsibility to stick to the truth as they are bound by a professional code that are formed to upholdÂ  the truth. However, the trust rests on the integrity of the individual journalist.  Despite the fact that daily practice in the business of journalism involves series of encounters with a range of issues that present ethical dilemmas for fellow pen pushers who have to contend with making right ethical decisions, the society must trust that the journalist will not betray the trust it bestows on them while practitioners must strive harder not to become dishonest in their judgment.
