Mikel begged to be excused from the squad because he is just recovering from injury, Victor Moses recently announced his retirement from the national team, while Simon Moses, according to Rohr, has suffered a recurrence of the injury that knocked him out of the World Cup. Nigeria will travel to Seychelles for a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier September 7 in Victoria.
 
The list has three goalkeepers, eight defenders, six midfielders and seven forwards. The coach explained that he decided to give China-based Odion Ighalo, who was a big flop in Russia, a chance to see if he could redeem himself in the team. “We want him to prove that he still knows how to score goals. Aside that, he is among the few experienced players in our young team. “We left out Elderson Echiejile because he is not playing right now. He is looking for a club, but we have some exciting young players in the fullback position. “Tyrone Ebuehi and Shehu Abdullahi are injured, but we have enough cover for them,” he said. The three goalkeepers are those who made the final cut for the FIFA World Cup finals in Russia in the summer, including Francis Uzoho, Daniel Akpeyi and Ikechukwu Ezenwa.
