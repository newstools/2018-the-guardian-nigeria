Wizkid is giving us goals. Weeks after Vogue dubbed him Africa’s hottest popstar by every measure and he unveiled his merch capsule collection, he has posted his jersey collaboration designs with international sports brand Nike. In February, when the intention to collaborate was made known, we reported that he will become the first African musician to have his own jersey when it scales through. Wizkid, it should recalled, was given an with an orange-coloured Starboy jersey. This new capsule, however, looks like it will take a slight turn from that colour to one more akin to green. Just like the Nigerian jersey, we are positive this will sell out. Wizkid Jersey.
