 Imam Mahroof Abdulazeez Onike  International Human Rights Defenders Forum is a Non-Governmental Organisation at the instance of the Carter Center inc., a pet project of former US President Jimmy Carter. NASFAT, in a statement signed by its spokes person, Banji Busari, said Imam Onike and his wife Sadiat Onike were the only two Nigerians among the 75 participants (comprising international NGOs, religious leaders, influential analysts, women peace makers, government and UN policy makers) drawn from 36 countries across the globe that participated in the campaign. They were hosted by former President Jimmy Carter to address the unequal treatment of people worldwide based on race, gender, nationality, age, ethnicity, religion, social and economic status or any other form of discrimination. Both of them participated in a panel discussion, where they advanced what NASFAT is doing in collaboration with the Carter Center to make life worth living for Nigerians using religion as a platform. During the 4-day conference themed: “Restoring Faith In Freedom”, the participants were united in their position that, “all human beings are equal in the eyes of God and it is the duty of each one of us to realise this mandate from our common creator”. The participants examined and deliberated on the phenomenon of the erosion of human rights across the globe occasioned by rising political repression to the growing number of people without an adequate standard of living. The participants therefore resolved to stand In solidarity to reverse this trend which they concluded if unchecked is capable of derailing democracy and strain people confidence in its most trusted institutions, while also threatening basic Universal Human Rights.
