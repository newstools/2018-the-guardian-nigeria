Niger State governor, Sani Bello Niger State Governor Sani Bello has faulted the rumour making the rounds that he would join some of his colleagues in defecting from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Sani, who spoke through his Political Adviser on Strategy, Chief Ray Murphy, maintained that there was no iota of truth in the report linking him to the move to dump the APC. Sani said he had no reason to dump the APC, saying he was happy with the party, alongside his teeming supporters in state. The governor recalled how he had to travel to Sokoto State to counsel Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal against his decision to dump the APC for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Murphy quoted the governor as saying that those who are decamping are making mistake, as where they are going to would not be better than APC. “As a member of the APC, the governor is satisfied and his people are satisfied and he is concerned with the progress of the APC in Niger State. “He has received cooperation from the people of Niger State, the party at the national level and from Mr. President and he has no reason whatsoever to leave the party. “He has a good relationship with the President, as a governor, as he said that those who are decamping are making mistake. He said nobody should link him with any thought of decamping, though those who are decamping are his associates, as governors. “He said one of the governors congratulated him for not defecting to PDP at the Wednesday meeting the governors held with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Villa,” he stated.
