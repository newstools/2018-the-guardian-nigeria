PDP Flag The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded the arrest and trial of the leaders of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, over the association’s comment on plot to forcefully remove the President of the Senate, Senator Bukola Saraki. PDP made the call in a Statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan on Wednesday in Abuja. Ologbondiyan said such “unguarded statement” echoed the threats by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Presidency, to force out Saraki, from office, describing it as ominous and revealing. He alleged that it had also been the same group that was being used to stoke division and create violent crisis that had resulted into daily blood lettings in various parts of the country. He wondered how the association had now become the fourth arm of government that could determine when and how to forcefully remove the number three citizen, the President of the Senate. He said it was in the light of these treasonable and inciting utterances by Miyetti Allah, PDP demanded that President Muhammadu Buhari, should within the next 24 hours, order the arrest and commence immediate trial of the leadership of the group. “Finally, the PDP is aware that Miyetti Allah does not represent the views and interests of the vast majority of cattle breeders or even any ethnic group in the country. “We therefore urge all good spirited Nigerians to rise in condemnation of the actions and utterances of these misguided elements, who are being used to attempt a constitutional breach that portends grave danger to national cohesion and our hard earned democracy. “(NAN).
