The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, was yesterday arrested and grilled by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) at the Abuja head office of the anti-graft body over alleged corrupt practices. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed that Ekweremadu arrived at the commission around nine in the morning to honour the invitation. Also confirming his grilling, Uwujaren, however, failed to adduce reasons for the detention of the deputy senate president by the agency. Ekweremadu had on July 24 this year failed to honour a summons from the EFCC seeking clarifications from him on some allegations bordering on corruption.
