‘Counter-terrorism strategy desk will be established in 36 states, FCT’
Worried by the unending security challenge in the country, the Retired Army, Navy and Air Force Officers (RANAO) Associations of Nigeria, has lamented Federal Government’s inability to proffer solutions to the problems. While urging Nigerians to defend themselves against Boko Haram and incessant herders attacks and killings across the country, they argued that insecurity in Nigeria has been turned into a business venture. Its National President, Major General Alexander Mshelbwala (rtd.), pointed out that Nigerians are turning insecurity into a business, while saying that the Boko Haram terrorists cannot spend more than five days in the bush without food, just as he wondered why the military should allow supply. He attributed the development to the country’s deteriorating civil responsibility and advised the people against relying entirely on the military for internal insecurity, adding that internal security should be everybody’s business. Speaking to journalists at the end of its ninth celebration in Kaduna, Mshelbwala said the authorities should go after those who are supplying Boko Haram food, weapons, logistics and military hard wares to end the killings and insurgency. Meanwhile, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development (NCWASD) has concluded plans to establish a National Counter Terrorism Strategy (NACTEST) Nodal desk in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. This was disclosed in a communiqué issued at the end of 18th Regular National Council Meeting on Women Affairs and Social Development organised by the Ministry in Lagos. The meeting with the theme: Peace, Security And Social Inclusion: Key Building Blocks For Achieving Economic Growth And Sustainable Development In Nigeria, was chaired by Aisha Jummai Alhassan. Speaking, Alhassan stressed that peace and security were essential for national development, as they serve to attract foreign investors. Secretary to the Lagos State Government (SSG), Tunji Bello, who represented Governor Akinwumi Ambode, appreciated the council for giving the state the hosting rights and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the inclusion of more women in the state’s affairs. Delegates from 34 states and the FCT, representatives of the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD), National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and commissioners led by the Dean of the College of Commissioners, attended the meeting. Others are permanent secretaries, directors of departments, Lagos State Police Command, United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, British Council, UNICEF, World Bank and representatives of civil society organisations (CSOs). It featured two sessions- the Technical Session presided over by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mrs. Ifeoma Anagbogu, while Alhassan chaired the ministerial session.
