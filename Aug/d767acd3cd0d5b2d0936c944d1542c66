Kanye West is one rap artist known not only for his hit tracks but for his unreserved opinions about issues such as politics and impressions. On Thursday he was interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel’s Talkshow, his first appearance since 2013. His infrequent interviews to the show were perhaps due to his feud with the host Jimmy Kimmel on social media. West has been open about his support for President Donald Trump which confounds some fans and colleagues considering his remarks in 2005, on President George W Bush, he had said, “President George W Bush doesn’t care about black people”.

But his response on why he supports Trump publicly was because he wanted to deviate from the notion that all blacks must be Democrats. In his words, “as a musician, African-American… everyone around me tried to pick my candidate for me.”
