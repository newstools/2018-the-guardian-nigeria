In an attempt to re-boot What Women Want, the 2000 Nancy Meyers film starring Mel Gibson, with a female lead, Paramount has announced another film titled What Men Want. Starring Taraji P Henson (playing Ali Davis), the film sees her having the ability to hear what men are thinking after she drinks a special kind of tea given to her. “I thought black people stopped drinking tea after Get Out.” Taraji P Henson in ‘What Men Want’. Photo: YouTube Davis is a successful sports agent who’s constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she is passed up for a well-deserved promotion, she questions what else she needs to do to succeed in a man’s world, until she gains the ability to hear men’s thoughts. With her newfound power, Ali looks to outsmart her colleagues as she races to sign the next basketball superstar, but the lengths she has to go to will put her relationship with her best friends and a potential new love interest to the test. The movie also stars Tracy Morgan, Richard Roundtree, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Tamala Jones, Max Greenfield, Erykah Badu and more. Watch the trailer below:
