FIFA has given the Nigeria an August 20 deadline to return the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) offices to Amaju Pinnick, else the NFF will be suspended. The World Football governing body’s ultimatum is due to the long drawn leadership tussle in the glass house between Pinnick and Chris Giwa. In a statement released on Tuesday, FIFA said Nigeria will be suspended for contravening the FIFA statutes in relation to undue influences, if the NFF offices are not handed back to the legitimate executive committee led by Pinnick. Pinnick emerged as the NFF president after an election in 30, September 2014. Giwa’s claims to the headship of the NFF stems from an election in August 2014, however FIFA stated they did not recognise the election. Giwa had on July 1, 2018 forcefully taken over the NFF secretariat as president-elect of the federation, claiming his authority from a Supreme Court ruling. But on July 23rd State Security operatives ejected the Giwa-led board to reinstate Pinnick and his executives. The statement said the suspension will be lifted when Pinnick and the NFF General Secretary Mohammed Sanusi, confirms that they have effective control of the NFF and its offices. According to FIFA, if the suspension takes effect, the Falconets competing at the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup in France will be allowed to remain in the tournament on an ‘exceptional basis given that the tournament is underway’. It could, however, affect the Super Eagles’ Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles on September 7. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
