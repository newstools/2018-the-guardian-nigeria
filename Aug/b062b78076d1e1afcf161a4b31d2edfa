Abacha is an Eastern Nigeria dish made using dried, shredded cassava. You can eat it as a snack or a full meal. There are many variations to making this salad, but the more ingredients you add, the tastier the dish is. Whichever way you prepare or eat it, warm or cold, it will still come out delicious. <img class="size-medium wp-image-720353 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-1062x598.png" alt="" width="1062" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-1062x598.png 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-640x360.png 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-320x180.png 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-281x158.png 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-562x316.png 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-531x299.png 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-487x274.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-974x548.png 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972-600x337.png 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Abacha.-Photo-Dailyfresheat-e1534627240972.png 1211w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" />
