Yomi Shogunle, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) has become the focus of an infuriated musician, JohnNetworQ. The song titled, What is A Yomi, outrightly questions his identity. With lyrics such as “your IQ is embarrassing, no empathy, no questioning, the robbery goes on gallantly”, the song is sure to grab your attention. Yomi Shogunle has been the subject of controversy since the campaign of #EndSARS began. He has been accused on several occasions of playing the devil’s advocate with the alleged victimisation and exploitation of Nigerian citizens. Read More: SARS: To End Or To Reform? He recently told Nigerians to retweet his tweet 186 million times for him to #EndSARS. In a recent interview with Guardian Life, Shogunle insisted that most of the social media posts calling for the proscription of the Nigerian police’s Sepcial Anti-Robbery Squad, notorious for brutality, were lies. He told Guardian Life that it is important for members of the public to lodge complaints with the Nigerian police through appropriate channels. Perhaps this is his way of ensuring that proper evidence is provided for accusations against the questionable actions of the unit. In a separate interview with Channels TV earlier June, Shogunle doubled down on his claims that SARS claims of police brutality had no evidence. “Why are people not going to the courts? Because they don’t have evidence or the facts they will use to pursue their cases,” he said. He claimed that most of the complaints against SARS are localised in Lagos State because of better “access to internet facilities”.
