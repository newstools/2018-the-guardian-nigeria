Philippe DESMAZES / AFP Super Eagles striker, Ahmed Musa has completed a transfer from Leicester City to Saudi Arabia club, Al Nassr. The Saudi club announced the signing of the World Cup star on a four-year deal believed to be worth £17.5 million. The deal reportedly makes him the highest paid Nigerian football player. Musa joined Leicester City in 2016 as a record signing for £16.6 million but failed to have an impact at the King Power. He was loaned to CSKA Moscow in the winter of 2018 to get more playing time after he failed to get a Premier League game in his second season.  The 25-year old scored six times in 10 appearances at the Russian club. He scored four goals in the 33 matches he played across two seasons. Musa leaves two of his compatriots Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho at the Foxes to join Al Nassr. Musa, who was arguably Nigeria’s best player at the Russia 2018 World Cup, second goal against Iceland ranked as the 8th best goal scored at the tourney. Musa will hope to hit the ground running when Al Nassr play their league opener against Ohod on August 30. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
