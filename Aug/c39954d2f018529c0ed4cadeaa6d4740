 Guy Loxley Clarke<br />Managing Executive: Vodacom Business International  With an estimated 198 million people – according to the National Population Commission (NPC) – dependence on existing infrastructure is mounting. Matching population growth with infrastructural development has become an issue of great concern across the country. Finding solutions to this growing concern, was the focus of the discourse at the recently concluded Information Communications Technology and Telecommunications (ICTEL) Expo, 2018 organised by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Speaking on behalf of Vodacom Business Nigeria, Executive Head of Operations (Ag), Olumide Idowu said: “Leaders around the world are committed to smart city building as they attempt to chart the course towards the development of their cities in order to meet social, economic, and environmental challenges.” Idowu noted that Nigeria is at a pivotal moment in its technological revolution and the current lack of infrastructure provides a ready springboard for the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to create a smarter and a more efficient nation. By using IoT technology, which is commercially available today, a host of intelligently connected services such as efficient healthcare in rural communities become possible a reality.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
