The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.69 percent, or 155.42 points, to 22,662.74 while the broader Topix index added 0.76 percent, or 13.15 points, to 1,746.05. The market moved in a tight range in early trade as investors sat on their hands ahead of planned Japan-US trade talks, slated for Thursday in Washington. Analysts speculated that Washington might urge Japan to open the market further for US exports and consider a bilateral free-trade agreement. Tokyo was expected to press Washington to return to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and stop considering possible tariffs on vehicle imports. “The market followed gains of US shares overnight and opened the trading day with the Nikkei index marking small gains,” Okasan Online Securities said in a note to clients.
