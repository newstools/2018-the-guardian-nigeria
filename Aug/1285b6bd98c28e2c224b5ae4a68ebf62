 Governor Emmanuel Udom  He said this, while receiving the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, who was on a solidarity visit to him, assuring his visitors that the party was still regarded as a religion in the state and that there was no cause for alarm. He said: “I want to assure you that we still have the party 98 per cent intact: The state Assembly 24 over 26, the state executive council 100 per cent, 31 local government council chairmen and councilors 100 percent, among others. With all these, we can only say that these men are leaving something behind for coming Akwa Ibom children to learn from.” Udom, who described Saraki’s visit as unprecedented, urged him not to be cowed by challenges facing him. The governor thanked his visitor and the National Assembly for their resilience, noting that their stance on some national issues was a clear sign of mentorship for younger Nigerians.
