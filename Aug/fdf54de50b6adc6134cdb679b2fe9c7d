Pink is a pop star known for her dramatic performance and hit songs and professionalism. With frustration, she postponed a concert last week but this was not her doing because she had contracted a gastric virus that made it very difficult for her to perform. Concerts slated for Monday was cancelled as fans were arriving the venue and Tuesday’s was postponed. Pink whose real name is Alecia Moore was admitted to a hospital in Australia and is being examined by doctors. She is scheduled to perform on Thursday, August 9 and it is not clear if the concert will hold since tickets are still being sold.

(Gord Waldner/ The StarPhoenix) Although some fans are sympathetic to her ill health and wishing her a quick recovery, others are disappointed and bashing her for cancelling the concert just shortly after the arrival of fans. According to reports, Pink has been battling with ill health since the marathon tour started in July. Before her arrival in Sydney Australia, she had tweeted to fans “Does anyone have a favourite place that makes wellness shots and fresh juices for when I get there?” Australian Paparazzi caught an image of her and her family on a beach and made it seem like her illness was feigned. When someone is a celebrity performer, some fans tend to put them on a pedestal above being human and expect that their limitations as humans will not manifest itself. We wish the star a quick recovery.
