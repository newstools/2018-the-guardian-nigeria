A boat Joseph had been riding in had capsized and one by one he saved 13 passengers, pulling them ashore. The diesel supplier had attempted saving the 14th person when, exhausted, he drowned. The Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, shared on his Facebook page that the endowment fund was revealed while he received Blankson’s wife, children and extended family at the Government House on Monday. Joseph’s wife, Mercy, was employed by the Rivers State government, while Wike also donated to the burial of the late hero. A service of songs in honour of the deceased will hold tomorrow, Thursday at No. 4, Harley Street, Old GRA, Port Harcourt. Meanwhile, former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has eulogised the 38-year-old Blankson who singlehandedly pulled 13 people out of the river in Degema local government area of Rivers on July 30. Atiku took to his Twitter account to hail Blankson as a “true Nigerian hero”. He said: “Joseph Blankson is a true Nigerian hero who met his tragic end in his quest to rescue others when the boat he was in capsized. Joseph is a reminder that all Nigerian lives matter. May he find rest among the saints.” On his part, Senate President Bukola Saraki, via his Twitter handle @bukolasaraki, posted: “Every now and then we hear amazing stories of Nigerian heroes. Joseph Blankson gave his life to save 13 people. I salute this Nigerian hero who by his last great act, showed us, once again, that we have remarkable people across this nation. His memory will be written in gold.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
