The pro-Brexit minister said that the chances of a no-deal Brexit were now “60-40”, laying the blame on EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. “I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal,” he said in an interview with the Sunday Times. “If the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it’s a bureaucrats’ Brexit — not a people’s Brexit — then there is only going to be one outcome.” He said that Barnier had rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest plan, agreed by her cabinet, on the grounds that “we have never done it before”.
