 Speaker, House of Representatives,  Yakubu Dogara  He specifically commended Okechukwu who joined other members of the lower legislative chamber to align with senators to protect the sanctity of the legislature while the siege by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) lasted. Also, the United Labour Congress, (ULC) and the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO), yesterday condemned the siege on the National Assembly by hooded men of the DSS and the Nigeria Police. While the CLO commended the Acting President Yemi Osibanjo for saving Nigeria from global harassment with the immediate sack of DSS Director General, Lawal Daura, the ULC described the early morning invasion of the legislative building as a rude shock. ULC President, Joe Ajaero, said in a statement that the development heightened Nigerians’ fears over the country’s stability and its ability to manage it internal affairs. Speaking, Executive Director of the CLO, Ibuchukwu Ezike, urged Osinbajo to also dismiss the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Kpotun Idris, for reducing the police force to a brute, lawless and bestial entity. While reacting to police involvement in the siege Ibuchukwu told The Guardian that the CLO was surprised that Idris failed to learn any lesson from history as he has continuously played the main opposition against all cherished values of democracy.They, therefore, urged Osinbajo to direct the immediate investigation of the matter and prosecute those who may have masterminded the siege.
