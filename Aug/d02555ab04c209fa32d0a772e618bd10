 Dapo Abiodun  A Governorship aspirant in Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, a wealthy politician who spoke to Journalists yesterday insisted that it was regrettable that many people share the view that politics in the country is “dirty” and have therefore kept away from participating in active politics. He then appealed to “ credible and capable” Nigerians with such opinion to discard it and participate actively in politics to contribute their own quota towards turning the misfortunes of the country around. In his opinion, that is the only means to “rescue the nation from self centred leaders”. He is among 27 other aspirants who have so far indicated their intention to contest the State’s number one seat.
