Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, APC National Publicity Secretary National publicity secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Bolaji Abdullahi has resigned from the party. Abdullahi announced his resignation hours after denying his exit from the party. He said, “In the last few days i have had to endure the flagrant usurpation of my role as a spokesman of the party in a manner that i consider unbefiting of a ruling party and inconsistent with my ethical standards.” “However, in a situation whereby my loyalty is constantly brought into question; my subordinates deployed to subvert my office; and my views constantly second-guessed on the basis of my political affiliation, it has become imperative for me to review my position. “In view of recent political developments in the country and within the All Progressives Congress (APC), I have decided to resign my position as the National Publicity Secretary as well as my membership of the party with effect from today.” Abdullahi said in a statement. Before his official resignation, APC’s opposition, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) had welcomed him to the party, but Abdullahi debunked the claims, saying “I came through the front door and will not go through the back door.” “It is not true that I have resigned and let me emphasise that there is no iota of truth in that report,” Abdullahi said on Tuesday. Political observers said Abdullahi’s resignation was expected, with insinuations of him being a “loyalist” to senate president Bukola Saraki who left the APC for PDP. Abdullahi was minister of youth and sports under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. He assumed office as APC national publicity secretary in January 2018.
