Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr is expected in the country today to begin preparations for Nigeria’s African Nations Cup qualifier against Seychelles next month. Nigeria, which lost its first match in the Cameroun 2019 African Nations Cup qualifying series to South Africa in Uyo last year, is expected to travel to Victoria, Seychelles on September for its second match before coming back home to host Libya. Among other things, Rohr is expected to inspect and choose the suitable stadium for the third qualifier, as well as reveal the names of players he would use for the two matches bearing in mind that one of his main stars, Victor Moses, has decided to quit the national team. According to a source close to the coach, Rohr is expected to meet with the technical department of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) this week to present his programme for the qualifiers, as well as settle some outstanding issues that cropped up at the Russia 2018 World Cup. The Guardian gathered that one of the issues is the fate of Chief Coach, Salisu Yusuf, who was implicated in a sting operation, where he was seen collecting money from football agents to field two players in the African Nations Championship (CHAN) hosted by Morocco early this year. Nigeria must beat Seychelles and Libya in the next two games to resuscitate its chances of making it to Cameroun next year. The Super Eagles are currently third on the table with zero points after the 0-2 loss to South Africa in the opening game.
