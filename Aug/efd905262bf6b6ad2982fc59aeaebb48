PHOTO: TWITTER A coalition of professionals in Nigeria and the Diaspora, Igbo Ekunie Initiative (IEI), has asked the police to release the over 100 Igbo women they arrested. In a statement by its president and secretary, Tochukwu Ezeoke and Lawrence Nwobu, they condemned the ‘unlawful’ arrest of the women in Owerri, the Imo State capital. The women were arrested for protesting against the continued disappearance of leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. The group flayed their arrest, torture by police and called for their immediate release with financial compensation. They said: “We strongly and unequivocally condemn the arrest and detention of these women by the security forces in Owerri, led by the state commissioner of police. “We are supposed to be in a practicing democracy and cannot understand why the Magistrate, Mrs. S.K. Durumba, before whom the women were charged, would refuse to discharge and acquit them.” The group expressed concern that the women were not granted bail as prescribed under the law, especially as the margistrate made it clear in her ruling that her court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. According to the group, the security forces have demonstrated brazen parochialism by arresting and detaining innocent people from the southeast, while aiding terrorist herdsmen from the north. They said this breach of constitutional responsibility was capable of igniting crises of unfathomable consequences in an already fragile nation. The group condemned the arrest of unarmed mothers for protesting peacefully over the disappearance of Kanu since the military invaded his home in Umuahia, Abia State.
It claimed that the women are currently being detained in police and military formations in appalling conditions. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
