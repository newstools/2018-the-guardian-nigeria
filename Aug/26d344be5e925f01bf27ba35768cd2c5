Akwa Ibom state governor, Udom Emmanuel Akwa Ibom state governor Udom Emmanuel has said he will announce his intention to run for governor for a second term on Friday. The governor in a post on his verified Twitter handle said he will ‘submit’ himself as the state’s ‘Servant-Leader’ just like he did in 2014. “Tomorrow, just as I did in 2014, I will submit myself again as your Servant- Leader and ask for your support for a second term.

Governor Emmanuel challenged his predecessor to a debate, he also claimed that only one senator (Bassey Albert) was “speaking for the whole of Akwa Ibom state in the Senate.
