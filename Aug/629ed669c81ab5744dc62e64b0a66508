Kofi Annan’s death is another loss of an icon, advocate and a voice. He was a Ghanian statesman who scaled heights in his lifetime. He not only served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, he was also a co-recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize with the UN. In a time when the world and Africa are facing turbulent times and a myriad of problems, one can only hope that these words of wisdom from him will mean something to the living. Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family. It has been said that arguing against globalization is like arguing against the laws of gravity.

Education is a human right with immense power to transform. On its foundation rest the cornerstones of freedom, democracy and sustainable human development. More countries have understood that women’s equality is a prerequisite for development. There is no development strategy more beneficial to society as a whole – women and men alike – than the one which involves women as central players. Business, labour and civil society organizations have skills and resources that are vital in helping to build a more robust global community. The Lord had the wonderful advantage of being able to work alone. We need to keep hope alive and strive to do better. If information and knowledge are central to democracy, they are conditions for development.
