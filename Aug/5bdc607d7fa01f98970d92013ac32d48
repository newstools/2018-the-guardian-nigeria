Nigerian Senate minority leader, Godswill Akpabio has, again, met the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Akpabio and Tinubu met in Lagos on Saturday before the former governor of Akwa-Ibom state met with president Muhammadu Buhari, who is on holiday in London. But, this time Akpabio who is believed to have perfected plans of defection to APC, met Tinubu along with APC chietain Alhaji Yusuf Ali in Abuja on Monday. An aide to president Muhammadu Buhari confirmed that the senator has left the PDP. “I’m confirming that the APC family as earlier indicated will formally receive H.E, Godswill Akpabio on WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 8,2018 at an elaborate ceremony in Akwa-Ibom State,” Buhari’s adviser on National Assembly (Senate) matters and former senator Ita Enang said. Akpabio’s defection will hand the APC, which only recently lost about 15 senators including Senate President Bukola Saraki to the leading opposition party the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), a massive boost in the South-south as the country gears up for its next general elections in February. It will also help the APC hold on to its majority in the Senate. In preparation for his switch of the party, Akpabio met with Senator Bola Tinubu in Lagos and President Muhammadu Buhari, who is on a 10-day holiday in London. This reported defection to APC comes days after he was welcoming former members of the APC who have left the ruling party for the PDP. “Our most important task as leaders is to engage in meaningful discussion and share ideas that will build the bridge between the struggle of today and the future we will all be proud of,” Akpabio tweeted after meeting Buhari.
