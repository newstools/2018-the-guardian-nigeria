Ibrahim Dankwambo Gombe state governor and 2019 presidential hopeful, Ibrahim Dankwambo, has promised that he will not be engaged in any blame game if elected president. Although Dankwambo did not mention any names, but current president Muhammadu Buhari who is often criticised for blaming past leaders for Nigeria’s problems, might be a target of the statement. “As your President, I will not blame anyone for Nigeria’s problems, I will fix them. Leaders are elected to solve problems.” Dankwambo said in a tweet. Dankwambo recently declared his intent to run for president in next year’s election under the platform of the People’s Democratic Party where he will be contesting the party’s ticket alongside former vice president, Atiku Abubakar and others. “After wide consultations with party members and Nigerians of diverse backgrounds. I, Dr Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo will be running for office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the platform of our great party, the People’s Democratic Party,” Dankwambo said. However, Dankwambo’s intent to run for the presidency is subject to PDP primary elections latest by November.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
