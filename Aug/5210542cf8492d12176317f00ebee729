Nigeria will travel to Seychelles on September 7 for their second match of the qualifying series and return home to face Libya in the third game on October 10. The Super Eagles lost their opening game in the series by 0-2 to South Africa in Uyo last year. Some NFF officials last week touted the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba as the likely venue for the match, but top officials of the federation and Super Eagles’ Coach, Gernot Rohr on Wednesday inspected the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna, which is an indication that the body may have chosen the northern city for the match. Rohr and NFF’s Second Vice President/LMC Chairman, Shehu Dikko, as well as Super Eagles administrator, Enebi Achor checked out the facilities at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium on Wednesday. After hosting Libya on October 10, the Super Eagles will meet the North African side again three days later in Tripoli, before flying to South Africa for the return leg against the Bafana Bafana on November 17. The last match of the series will see the Eagles hosting Seychelles on March 22, 2019. Read More: NFF considers Asaba Stadium for Super Eagles versus Libya qualifier The NFF in a statement yesterday revealed that Rohr would release the list of players he intends to use for the match against Seychelles on Friday. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Torino of Italy defender, Ola Aina, who narrowly missed the cut for the Russia 2018 World Cup, will be included in the new squad. He, alongside former Golden Eaglet, Musa Mohammed is expected to vie for the full back positions in the absence of the injured Tyrone Ebuehi and Shehu Abdullahi. Mohammed was last invited for an official Super Eagles game during the World Cup qualifiers, but in May, Musa captained the B team against Atletico Madrid in a friendly.
