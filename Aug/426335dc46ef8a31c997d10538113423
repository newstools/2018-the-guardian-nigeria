National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has rescued 12,939 victims since its establishment in 2003. The director-general, Dame Julie Okah-Donli, stated this yesterday while delivering a paper entitled ‘Mass Exodus of Youths and national Development: A case of Nigeria-Libya-Europe Migration Trend’ in the 16th Ika Ka Mma annual lecture organised by the Onu Ika socio-cultural organisation. She described trafficking as a component of terrorism and major threat to good governance and economic recovery of any nation. Onu Ika is an umbrella organisation of the Ika nationality of Delta State. According to her, Delta ranks third among source states for human trafficking, only behind Edo and Kano. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta expressed sadness over the human trafficking situation in the state and called on parents to advise their children to remain in Nigeria and avail themselves of various opportunities available to better their lives.
