Sony has announced that its Aibo robotic dogs infused with artificial intelligence will be unleashed on the US market by the year-end holiday season, with a price tag of $2,899 (N1051931.14). The sixth-generation mechanical pup combines robotics with image sensors and artificial intelligence, enabling it to learn behaviours and recognise faces, according to the Japanese consumer electronics giant.

Similar to real-life dogs, Aibo can learn tricks and will seek out owners, reacting to words of praise or scratches on the head, according to Sony. Aibo will also play with toys, which Sony will sell you. Unlike real-life dogs, Aibo has an application that owners can use to adjust system settings or add new tricks, and can connect to the internet cloud to store memories.

Sony will begin taking US orders for “First Litter Edition” Aibo next month, with deliveries promised by the holiday season. Aibo became available in Japan early this year, more than a decade after it culled earlier models from its product line. ***AFP
