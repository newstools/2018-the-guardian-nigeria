The Lagos State police command at the weekend arrested a man who allegedly specialises in luring women on Facebook with the motive of raping and robbing them. A man identified as Richard Samuel Gbenga reportedly invited a Facebook user whom he connected with on the social media site in July to a dinner supposed to hold in Lekki area of Lagos on August 4. As agreed with the victim, Gbenga arrived at the take off point in a Toyota Camry car with registration number JJJ 406 DL driven by one Ayo Salau, an alleged member of his robbery gang. On their way to Lekki, they pulled over at a lonely spot, armed with cutlasses, and ordered the victim who pleaded to be anonymous to take off her clothes or be killed. While she was naked, they took turns to rape her after she had been robbed of her wristwatch and undisclosed amount of cash. As soon as the suspects left, the victim raised the alarm and gave description of their car. Police operatives attached to Maroko Division were alerted and immediately they laid ambush for the fleeing criminals. Immediately police operatives stopped their vehicle, the criminals took to their heels. The officers chased them and arrested Ayo Salau while his partner in crime, Richard Samuel Gbenga escaped. The suspect has since been identified by the victim and he confessed to have committed the crime. He added that his fleeing partner recruited him for the job. The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State command, CP Edgal Imohimi, cautioned youths, especially young women, to beware of people who may use the social media to take advantage of them. He gave the assurance that the long arm of the law will catch up with the fleeing suspect.
