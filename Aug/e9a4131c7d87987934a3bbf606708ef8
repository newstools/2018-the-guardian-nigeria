Optimal Specialist Hospital has levied execution of the judgment of the Yaba Magistrate Court, which empowered them to recover debt from UNIC Healthcare Limited. In doing so, the claimants collected two ambulance buses from the defendant. The action followed the judgment of the court delivered by Mrs A.O Ajibade as a result of an action filed by Optimal Specialist Hospital against the defendant. The court had in a judgment delivered in 2014 ordered that the sum of N3, 139, 836 being payment of the money representing the medical bills for health care services to the events of the defendant from March, 2011 to February 2014 be paid to the claimant. The court also ordered that the defendant should pay interest on the stated sum at the prevailing bank rate of 21 percent from October 2011 till the day of judgment and liquidation of the debt to the plaintiff. “The sum of N200, 000 is hereby awarded in favour of the claimant in this case as the cost of this action. “The first order is hereby ordered to be complied with before the defendant takes any further step in this case,” the magistrate ruled, adding that she was convinced that the plaintiff is entitled to its claims having perused all the documents filed before the court.
