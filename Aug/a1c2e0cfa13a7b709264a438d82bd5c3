The Governor announced his defection on August 1, 2018, at the Government House, Sokoto, North-West Nigeria. Other persons that are in the thumbnail include the former Ogun state governor, Segun Osoba and Oyo state governor, Abiola Ajimobi. The video, 6 minutes, 39 seconds long, was shot at the colloquium held to mark the 66th birthday of the national leader of the ruling party, Bola Tinubu at the Eko Hotel, Lagos, on March 29, 2018. The party while reacting to Tambuwal’s defection advised him to maintain in his environments the spirit and atmosphere of “freedom created by the APC, which enabled him to leave without let or hindrance.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
