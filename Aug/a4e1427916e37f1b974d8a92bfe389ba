The will is about the use of the mind. The will provides the mechanism of how the mind is being manipulated to achieve results. For the mind to function effectively, it has to be grounded on the will that functions on clear methodology of intelligence; meaning the clear understanding of how cause and effect are connected to give desired on fulfilling results. The cardinal importance of the will incidentally enough as I had previously mentioned is highlighted in the teaching of some revered religious personalities. Actually, the tenet of Islam is ‘submission to the will of God and Jesus in his Lord’s Prayers said, ‘thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.’ If man, everywhere, could pay attention on the understanding of the Will, rather than trying to make sense of religion and religious conflicts ill health would have been a thing of the past or drastically minimized. This is because the mind would have been properly focused to know what kind of relationship he has with God, and would have known that, that relationship is in the proper understanding of the functions of the will both for man and for God. Then, that statement that man is made in the image of God according to the scriptures will be fully appreciated. When Jesus said Father not my will, but your Will’, the implication of this is that both man and God have Will Power. The implication of this statement by Jesus was that man in any given situation of life must understand the technicalities of operation of both the will of God and man and for man to be able to develop the intuitive capacity to know how to allow his own will to submit to the will of God. This simply was what Muhammed came about to establish as the fundamental truth of religion, which he called Islam – and which he explained as submission to the will of God. According to Him, Islam is the only true of religion that binds all humanity. When human beings begin to allow their minds to develop the principle of intelligence, then they will be on the road to the constructive approach of solving all problems because problem solving is about the constructive application of the will. It is not really dependent on foolish sentiments and cultural parochialism. It is a scientific and true scientific approach to anything is about the application of intelligence in its understanding it.
