Gaga’s stylist, Tom Eerebout, who has been part of Gaga’s creative team since 2016, confirmed that the new design was by Slimane, saying, “He gifted her the bag and it’s the first one from his new collection. The handbag will be presented at Paris Fashion Week this September as part of Slimane’s first collection for Céline. Lady Gaga with the first Celine Bag By Heidi Slimane.

According to Eerebout, Gaga has a “massive archive” of Slimane’s work for Yves Saint Laurent, where the creative director ruled from 2012 to 2016. In 2012, Gaga was the first celebrity to wear a full look from the Saint Laurent Spring/Summer 2013 collection only a week after the runway show. Eerebout says, “They’re really close friends and they have been since he photographed her for The Fame Monster album cover.”
