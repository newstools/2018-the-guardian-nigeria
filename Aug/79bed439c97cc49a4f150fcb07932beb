Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment. Nigeria’s Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, said he is being pressured by his constituency to run for a seat in the Nigerian Senate in next year’s elections. Ngige spoke at a briefing at Obosi in the Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State, saying the people of the state and South-East leaders want him in the Nigerian Senate. The minister who represented Anambra Central District in the Senate between 2011 and 2015 disclosed that he is also considering to contest for his previous seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general elections. “The people who are pressurising me are my constituents; the people of Anambra State and some prominent people from the South-East,” Ngige said. “I am considering it, I am consulting and the result of my consultations will be made known in a fortnight.” Ngige said he will make an official declaration regarding his intent and his portfolio as minister in two weeks time. Ngige claimed the allegation that President Muhammadu Buhari government’s impact had not been felt in the entire South-East, were deliberate falsehood and a campaign of calumny from the opposition. He said, “The Federal Government of Nigeria has been generous to the people of the South-East; I am from the South-East. You see the President promised us infrastructure development and the South-East has not been left out,” Ngige said.
