 Adams Oshiomhole, APC leader  The 15 youth leaders, who spoke to The Guardian yesterday, said they were not intimidated by the macabre dance by the older politicians. National media director for Youth Take Over and Alliance for Greater Africa Foundation (YAGA), Nathan Simeon, noted that “the re-grouping of old looters is a call on all youths to unite irrespective of religion and tribe to positively impact the country”. According to him, it is necessary for youths to realise that power cannot be given, but must be taken. “If they are not ready to unite and take the required actions for a better Nigeria, the wind of political infirmity will never cease to blow. “These are the same people coming together with rebranded names and different platforms to make you feel they are concerned about the current state of things in the country. They are not defecting because they are not comfortable with your situation, but for their own selfish interests.” In a communiqué issued after a meeting of the 15 young aspirants under the aegis of Visionary Presidential Aspirants Coming Together (PACT) in Abuja, they condemned the coalition and defection pranks and antics, while describing them as “calculated attempt to deceive the mass of the people”. Signatories to the communiqué include Omoyele Sowore, Fela Durotoye, Tope Fasua, and Kingsley Moghalu. In a related development, Governor Sani Bello of Niger State has faulted insinuations that he would soon defect from the All Progressives Congress (APC).
