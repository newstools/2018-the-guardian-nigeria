 Director General of the National Youth Services Corp, Brigadier General Suleiman Zakari Kazaure  Kazaure said efforts were being made to increase the monthly allowance currently at N19,800 while applauding them for service to their fatherland. Addressing the 2018 Batch B corps members yesterday at Bauchi State Orientation Camp in Wailo, Ganjuwa council, Kazaure urged them to Bauchi to be patient with government. The DG, who was represented by the scheme’s Director of General Duties, Habib Kurawa, commended corps members for the services they had been rendering to the country, especially in the area of education. Their contribution to national development is part of the reasons all efforts are in place to ensure that their allowance is increased, he noted. Informing them that the United Nations (UN) and other international agencies appreciate the role of NYSC members in their various places of primary assignments, he said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would engage them in the 2019 general election. Kazaure warned them to steer clear of electoral malpractices, but to be good ambassadors of the scheme. Urging the corps members not to be partisan while on electoral duty, he advised them to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the Bank of Industry (BoI) and others to secure loans for their entrepreneurship development. The state NYSC coordinator, Afolayan James, explained that 2,044 corps members, comprising 1,186 males and 858 females, were registered in the state for the Batch ‘B’. He informed that Bauchi government officials visited the camp to see the damages caused by the recent rainstorm in the state and promised to repair the camp. Afolayan added that the corps members had received part of their allowances, assuring that they would be given the remaining before they leave the camp.
