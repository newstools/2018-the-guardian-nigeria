 APC leader, Adams Oshiomole  The party raised the alarm in a statement issued by Mr Yekini Nabena, its National Publicity Secretary on Sunday in Abuja. It said that the fake website was a scam sponsored by a “main opposition party,” stressing that it was not authorised by its leadership. “We alert our supporters, members, and indeed the general public about a purported membership registration website of the All Progressives Congress (APC) – apcregistration.com. “The website which is trending on social media is unauthorised and a scam. “Our internal investigation has revealed that the fake website is sponsored by one of the main opposition political parties in its desperate and criminal plot to harvest APC members ahead of the 2019 general elections. “We have deliberately not named the political party and hereby call on relevant security agencies to urgently investigate the website and its sponsors,” the party said. It urged its teeming supporters and members to take advantage of the on-going nationwide APC membership registration in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT to register. According to the party, the exercise will include both fresh registrations and revalidation of existing membership for the purposes of issuance of its permanent membership cards.
