Tiwa Savage spoke to Vogue about making a mark in the male-dominated Afrobeats genre. Photo credit: Instagram/TiwaSavage At the interview which held at her recently opened pop-up store in London, she told the magazine, “Afrobeats is a new genre to the world, so to have people that are dedicated to me, that take time out of their busy schedules and money out of their pockets to see me… it means so much. I don’t even like calling them fans – they’re like family, they’re like friends. They fuel me, they make me go on..” She also revealed that her fans are mostly women. When asked about the pressure she might be facing from fans, she said, “I’m just enjoying my life and working hard, and hopefully that in itself is an inspiration to other females. I’m not waking up and thinking, ‘Oh, I have to prove this or prove that.’ My life is a testimony in itself.”
