Six years after Kendrick Lamar’s released his mad (literally) studio album, Good kid, m.A.A.d. city, the album continues to make history. Billboard has revealed that the hip-hop album still sits in its Billboard 200 charts. Standing at number 116, what this translates to is 300 weeks on the chart. This feat makes him the second after Eminem and the fourth hip-hop album to do so in the current chart. Eminem, a genius on a whole new level, has three albums on the chart: 2010’s Recovery (312 weeks), 2002’s The Eminem Show (354 weeks) and 2005’s Curtain Call: The Hits (403 weeks). Altogether, 22 albums of different genres have achieved this.
