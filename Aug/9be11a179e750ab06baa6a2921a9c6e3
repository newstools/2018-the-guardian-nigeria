The 23-year-old, who has two years left on his contract, scored his 50th league goal on Sunday as the defending champions started their campaign with a comfortable 2-0 away win. “We are delighted with him and would like Raheem to stay,” Guardiola told reporters. “We’ll do our effort to make him feel we count on him. And we do count on him.” British media reported that Sterling’s agents are seeking a new contract in the region of £300,000 a week, which would make him one of the club’s highest paid players. Although Guardiola is not part of the negotiations, he said the club have already proved how much they want the player to stay. “In the end, the agents may not have agreements and that may not happen,” the Spaniard added. “But he knows and his agent knows we like him and want him a lot.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
