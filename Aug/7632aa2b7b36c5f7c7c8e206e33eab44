 University of Calabar  In a communique issued by its National Chairman, Dr. Abiodun Ogunyemi, after the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held at the University of Calabar (UNICAL) between August 4 and 5, 2018, the union said the multiple malaises that have constantly conspired and are still conspiring against our developmental aspiration as citizens in the Nigerian state and education, which are the kernel of transformation in any society, are being treated with levity. Ogunyemi said the expected renegotiation exercise was to be completed within six weeks but “since then, for over 14 months, our union has had series of negotiation meetings but had been a fruitless exercise as the Chairman of the Government Renegotiating Team, Dr. Wale Babalakin (SAN), constituted a stumbling block in the process of the renegotiation.” He said: “ASUU went on strike on August 12, 2017 to press for the implementation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement and the 2013 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between ASUU and the Federal Government. The strike culminated in the signing of a Memorandum of Action (MoA) and subsequent suspension of a six-week nationwide action on September 19, 2017.
