 Managing Director, Presco, Felix Nwabuko  Public Relations Manager/Head of Administration of Presco Plc, Mr. Anthony Uwajeh told The Guardian that the company was not aware of any encroachment on the community’s land measuring 2,500 hectares as it was only processing the land documents allocated by the Edo State government to the oil firm. He said, “the land allocated to Presco is a reserve in Uronigbe forest reserve and has been surveyed and the Certificate of Occupancy is being processed. We have no knowledge of any land measuring 2,500 hectares being encroached.” But Indigenes of Orogho community in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State have appealed to the Oba of Benin, HRM, Oba Ewuare II and Edo State Government to prevail on Presco Plc to stop the alleged encroachment on their community land. The community who called on Presco Plc not to lay claim to the 2,500 hectares of land allegedly allocated to them by the state government, said they were not consulted in the purported 2,500 hectares of land to the company. In a statement signed by elders and indigenes of Orogho community, which was made available to newsmen in Benin city yesterday, reaffirmed the community’s support and loyalty to the Oba of Benin and Edo State government over the 14,000 plus hectares of land duly given to Presco Plc by Oba Erediauwa of blessed memory, Edo State government and indigenes of Orogho community for agricultural  purposes.
