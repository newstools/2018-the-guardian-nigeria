PHOTO: AL.COM The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) yesterday announced its decision to part ways with D’Tigress’ Coach, Sam Vincent, saying it has appointed Otis Hughley in his place. According to the NBBF, the decision to terminate Vincent’s appointment was taken after extensive consultations and assessment of the team’s progress in camp ahead of the 2018 FIBA Women World Cup in Tenerife, Spain. In a letter signed by the NBBF President, Musa Kida, the federation said the decision was taken in the best interest of all parties involved and the long term interest of the D’Tigress. NBBF stated that considering the numerous conflicting commitments of the 55-year-old coach, which has continued to affect his duties as the coach of the team, the latest decision became pertinent. The letter stated in part that, “The NBBF has been monitoring the situation in Atlanta closely and we are not satisfied with a lot of things. You left the National Women’s Team Camp in Atlanta since Friday 27th July, 2018, without permission from anybody and you have continuously remained absent.” Following investigations, it said the 2017 Afrobasket winning coach was found guilty of abandoning the team due to other conflicting professional engagements within the United States of America where the team is currently camped. In view of the importance of giving the team the best of preparation for the World Cup as to make a mark in Spain, the NBBF decided to hire a coach who will spend more time in camp preparing the team. “Be informed that you are hereby relieved of your appointment as our National Women’s Coach, to allow you concentrate better on your other activities,” the letter stated. The board promised to compensate him for the services rendered while with the team. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
