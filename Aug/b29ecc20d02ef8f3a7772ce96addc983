 9mobile center  Tagged Girls Connect, this initiative is a pioneering partnership created by Girl Effect – a Non-governmental organisation (NGO) that uses media and mobile technology to empower girls, and IT company, iSON Group. Together they developed the innovative service that enables girls to draw inspiration using an interactive voice response platform on their mobile phones, and also learn more from qualified women that talk through the stories they have heard to make them more meaningful to the girls’ lives. With 9mobile’s support for the initiative, girls and young female adults will be able to access on-the-go and free of charge, information that can enhance their economic wellbeing, state of health and wellness as they interact with the specially-trained role models on their mobile phones. Speaking at the launch of the initiative in Kano on Tuesday, July 24, the Chief Human Resource Officer, 9mobile, Abigail Isokpan, said the partnership was borne out of the telecom company’s passion for development of its customers, host communities, and indeed Nigeria. “We are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to create value; and one of the ways we are achieving this is by aligning our business agenda with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
