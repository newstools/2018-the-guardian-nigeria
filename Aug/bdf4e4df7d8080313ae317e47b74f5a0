Nigeria has been in every edition of the competition and was twice runners-up. But the team’s dream of getting its hands on the trophy this time around would be cut short if it failed to beat Haiti. The Falconets were boosted by the news that one of their stars, Monday Gift is now fit to play and will be ready to feature against Haiti. The left footed star was part of the team’s training sessions on Tuesday and yesterday and looked sharp ahead of the crucial tie. The other Group D clash between Germany and China PR also looks a fascinating one, with the sides both victorious in their opening games and keen to book a quarterfinal berth. Adding further spice to the mix is the fact that the pair have faced off three times before in this competition, with the Steel Roses yet to taste victory. The Asian side lost out in the 2004 final and again in the group stage in 2012, before managing a draw at the same stage in 2014.
