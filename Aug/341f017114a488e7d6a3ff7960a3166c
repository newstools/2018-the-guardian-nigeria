Last Friday FALANA  hosted guests to an evening of musical bliss at an exclusive listening concert of her latest work and extended play (EP): Chapter One. The event which was supported by ALARA and Belvedere was a huge success and a night to remember.

Her music took audiences on a journey blending contemporary sounds and truly compelling lyrics that promises to resonate with audiences upon release. In her true fashion of sticking to her African roots and promoting her love for her Nigerian heritage, the artiste donned two outfits that reflected the Nigerian uniqueness. Guests in attendance included Tunde Folawiyo, Adekunle Gold, Steve Babaeko, Oscar Onyema, Bovi, Adesua Dozie, Ebi Williams, Mimi Onalaja, Inidima Okojie, Denola Grey, Rikki Stein, Tokini Peterside, Wavy The Creator, Odunsi the engine, Kaylah Oniwo amongst others.
