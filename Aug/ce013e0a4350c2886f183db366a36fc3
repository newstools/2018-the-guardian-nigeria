Summer school within the context of this essay refers to academic or semi-academic sessions which most private schools in Nigeria organise for crèche, primary school pupils and secondary school students during the long vacation. Outside its contextual reference are the JAMB preparatory schools or institutes organised for special topics during the long holidays between July and September every year when the new session starts. My query is on the abuse of the concept by some school proprietors to the detriment of the health of kids, the overall well-being of teachers and the abdication of parental responsibilities. There is a great deal of economic exploitation, ignorance, vanity and outright irresponsibility. It further promotes the poor bonding between parents and their kids in their growing up years. As a parent I have never sent any of my kids to the so-called summer coaching. And by God’s providence they have all gone through university! The regular school system is designed in such a manner that after a long session of academic work, both teacher and pupil/student need some time off regular work. It is time to relax, travel, spend time with family and do ordinary things which people are not able to do during the session. As a boy I always looked forward to the long holidays. It gave us the opportunity to just sleep and wake up as we liked. We read all the western novels that existed – James Hadley Chase, Sidney Sheldon, Nick Carter, Agatha Christie, and many more. We played football. We played hide-and-seek. Sometimes I like some other classmates did vacation jobs where we were paid some money. When we got to Primary Five, extra lessons were organised to help us pass the Common Entrance examinations to secondary school.
