Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has stated that he is not afraid of any probe, provided it is fair and just, boasting that no investigation on fraud, with respect to finances of the state, would ever incriminate him. Ortom, in a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Tahav Agerzua, while reacting to media reports credited to Benue State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), which countered some issues in his state broadcast a few days ago, said the APC would bury its face in shame soon when the governor begins to inaugurate the projects he started and completed after the party has claimed that he has not executed any project since assumption of office, as beneficiaries of the projects were eagerly waiting for them to be commissioned for their use. Agerzua also said the APC in the state has become a one-man business and this was one of the reason why his principal, the governor, left the party. “That the APC state chairman would react on half of a serving senator is indeed confirmation that he has pocketed both the party and its officials to the extent that they are out to dance to his whims and caprices at the slightest opportunity. “No wonder, most major stakeholders who had been suffocated in the APC have left to find breathing space in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), while those left in the demigod’s prison remain in chains to do his bidding no matter how odious. “The most unfortunate thing is that in a bid to please the slave master, all manner of lies and concoctions have to be fabricated. “Moreover, there is every indication that both the feudal lord and his slaves have since alienated themselves from the people; hence they do not know what is on ground, even at their doorsteps,” Agerzua said.
