 PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan  May will be visiting Nigeria on Wednesday where she will meet with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja to discuss the promotion of British trade and interest. “This is particularly as we have been made aware of plans by the Federal Government to use the visit to dish out more lies to the international community in an effort to cover its failures in governance in the last three years,” PDP’s spokesman kola Ologbondiyan said in a statement. “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) urges the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, to use her state visit to Nigeria to uncover the dismal state of our nation by resisting a choreographed plan by the Buhari Presidency to hoodwink her for an endorsement stunt,” Ologbondiyan added. The opposition party charged the British Prime minister “to insist on visiting other parts of the nation to enable her directly appreciate the level of lies and false performance indices the Federal Government has been dishing out to the world.” Ologbondiyan also said the British prime minister should question Buhari on the N4 trillion unremitted oil money in agencies under his direct supervision as the minister.
