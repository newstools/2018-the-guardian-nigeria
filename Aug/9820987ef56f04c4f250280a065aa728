Ekpo who will be running under the Social Democratic Party (SDP) declared his intent when he bought the gubernatorial form at the party’s national headquarters in Abuja. The Commissioner for Justice in Cross River state under the Donald Duke administration of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) left the party this year to join the SDP, saying the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP have failed Nigerians. On his defection, Ekpo lamented that the parties failed to provide Nigerians with needed economic improvement, social amenities and infrastructural development. “SDP stand for real progress for our people, real development for our people, that is the driven and collective desires and that all of us will climb up to the ladder of life,” Ekpo said. “For the last 19 years, what we all know as the mainstream, whether it was PDP or APC, they all have failed us,” “We are not without hope and that hope today lies in SDP and our message will go forth among the people of Cross River State,” Ekpo said. Prior to the announcement of his gubernatorial ambition, Ekpo said politics was not about winning elections but to give the people of Cross River the much-needed wealth they deserve. Ekpo is currently an executive member of business development at General Electric – Transportation To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
