 Olushola Ogunnowo. PHOTO: Nationwide League One  Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the league, Shola Ogunnowo said yesterday that some clubs employed armed police officers to checkmate violence, but the conduct of these police officers had not created a conducive atmosphere for smooth flowing football due to high level of bias and intimidation by the men, who were engaged to provide security services in games involving teams sponsored by the Nigeria Police Force. “We are happy that Nigeria Police Force have some clubs they are sponsoring in the NLO, but the use of armed police officers by these clubs is unacceptable by the NLO. This action is against the rules administering football all over the world as approved by FIFA and this practice must stop henceforth,” Ogunnowo said. “The Secretariat has decided that states’ Football Associations should endeavour to engage other security officers for the league matches involving Nigeria Police sponsored football clubs. The Nigeria Civil Defence Corp, The Nigeria Legion etc., are among other security services that can be engaged in league matches in NLO since football event is civil,” he added.
