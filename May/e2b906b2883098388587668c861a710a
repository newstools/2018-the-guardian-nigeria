Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has dropped four players from the Super Eagles provisional squad. Kano Pillars’ Junior Lokosa, Plateau United goalkeeper, Dele Ajiboye, Bulgaria-based defender Stephen Eze and Standard Liege’s Uche Agbo have been cut from the 30-man provisional list. The German coach said previously that he’d reduce the squad to 25 players before the team travels to London for the friendly against England.  However, the team retains an extra player. Injured winger, Simon Moses will travel with the squad for further scans to determine the extent of his thigh injury.
