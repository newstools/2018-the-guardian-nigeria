 The Minister of State for Aviation, Mr. Hadi Sirika  Operations of the proposed new national carrier, now set for December 24, 2018, has rekindled hope for the aviation industry,  especially for over 90 redundant Bilateral and Multilateral Air Service Agreements (BASAs and MASAs).	 
 
Stakeholders, who welcomed the takeoff date yesterday, said only a national carrier could effectively represent the country, compete on the international front and put an end to rather dismal outings of flag carriers. Besides,  Nigerian air travellers stand to benefit from competitive prices and services on several routes where foreign carriers are currently enjoying  monopoly. 
 
Several months of planning and paper works by the Ministry of State for Aviation yielded a major result last weekend as the Federal Government okayed December 24 date for the national carrier roll out.  Nigeria has three airlines — Arik Air,  Med-View and Air Peace —designated on few of the BASA routes. Except for Air Peace that is making waves on the West Coast, others have been woeful in international operations.
   
Currently, Arik Air has abandoned its New York,  London,  Johannesburg and West Coast operations. Ditto for Med-View Airlines on the London,  West Coast and Dubai operations, that was only launched last December.
