  Peterside, who made the assertion while appearing on a radio programme in Port Harcourt, yesterday, said: “In a big party, there would be different tendencies. What is seen as internal crisis in Imo State is a struggle for the party’s structure, and the National Working Committee has intervened. The Vice President of the country, as a leader of the party, has intervened. These are people who understand what it means to seek proper internal channels of the party to resolve issues. They didn’t approach any court. “In Ekiti, indeed they had an election that ended in stalemate. They have also sought internal party processes to resolve their issues. They didn’t approach any court. But, because we have a ‘monkey’s hand in the soup’, our case in Rivers is different. The democratic path is to create institutions where you can seek redress within the party.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
