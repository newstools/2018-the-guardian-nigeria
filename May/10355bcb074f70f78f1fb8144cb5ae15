  The PDP in a statement issued in Benin City by its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare said the execution of the dastardly act was carried out in the presence of Governor Godwin Obaseki by alleged APC members who were kitted in black. The statement said, “Friday, April 27, 2018, Distinguished Senator Matthew Urhoghide in the presence of Gov Godwin Obaseki was attacked by APC led government sponsored thugs as he disembarked from the plane that brought him from Abuja.  After observing and supervising the attack, with a smirk on his face, the governor climbed into his Jeep and gave a fist pump in approval and solidarity with his thugs for a mission accomplished.” Read More: APC’s ‘symbolic sweeping’ of PDP zonal rally venue clownish According to the party, “This act is another evidence of the disdain and intolerance with which the APC government views the legislature and opposition voices. In their glaring failure, they exhibit executive rascality, misplaced power arrogance and obvious ignorance of constitutional rights and roles of the three arms of government. “Arising from the ugly event at the airport, it is now obvious that the APC at state and federal level are fast losing grip in the act of governance. In their desperate efforts to cling on to power, they have resorted to state sponsored hooliganism. “Senator Urhoghide cannot be cowed, intimidated or harassed. He will continue to carry out his constitutionally assigned role as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Edo PDP will send a report of this ugly incident to the police for investigation and necessary action.” The PDP however appealed to its members and supporters in Edo South to remain calm and law abiding while the police carry out their investigation.
