 Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon gestures during the “Notte del Maestro” (master’s night), a football match celebrating the end of former Italy’s football player Andrea Pirlo’s career as a football player, on May 21, 2018 at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium in Milan.  / AFP PHOTO / MARCO BERTORELLO  Buffon, 40, played his final game for the Italian giants in a 2-1 win over Verona on Saturday, capping a 17-year career in Turin that harvested seven consecutive Serie A titles. “PSG? I need a week to be calm and analyse everything. These aren’t simple choices. At 40, you can’t make decisions in the heat of the moment,” Buffon told Sky Sports Italia after playing in former Italy team-mate Andrea Pirlo’s testimonial at the San Siro on Monday. “Do I speak French? No,” he added. Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi earlier in the day poured cold water on suggestions Buffon could step in to replace the French club’s number one goalkeeper, Alphonse Areola. Al-Khelaifi told L’Equipe sports daily: “He (Buffon) is a fantastic goalkeeper, he’s very charismatic and is a true gentleman. I’m sure all the clubs want him.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
