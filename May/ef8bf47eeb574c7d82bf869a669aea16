Growing up in Umuahia under the parentage of a high court judge and an educationist, a young Amadi-Obi found himself completely obsessed with drawing and making art. But his family only recognised two professions: law and medicine. So, it was only natural for him to study Law after his father, not knowing that he could thrive like some of the “mythical” renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso that he loved to read about.

His time in school provided a ground for experimenting. But that parental support was absent. “As far as my dad was concerned, he had one more lawyer,” Amadi-Obi says. Regardless, he was undeterred. His brand, Dezulu, a name which he signed on his artworks, became famous in school. Realising the power of branding, he found a way to distinguish himself from other artists and developed a trust with his clients to always deliver an excellent job. “There and then I realised that I will never be poor or hungry, as far as I follow my passion and I did not slack on my craft.” With his lighthearted and easy-going demeanour, unique style and mastery of aesthetics and creative lighting, Kelechi Amadi-Obi has earned international renown for his work. Passion, mastery of his art and an uncanny ability to capture visuals are the trademarks that have seen him work with the best brands and organisations. But it was his determination—very much against the will of his parents—that set him on the path of light and camera.
