All is set for music unlimited as Showgear, an entertainment promotion outfit, and its organizing partners have announced that Lagos will be joining the global celebration of music in the month of June for a third consecutive year under the umbrella of Make Music Lagos (MML). Make Music Lagos is the Lagos version of Make Music Day, a festival of free live music that holds in more than 120 countries across the world to commemorate World Music Day under the guidance of the US based Make Music Alliance. Since its launch, the MML festival has had two back-to-back editions. The first in 2016, which delivered three concerts with performances by Bez, Cobhams Asuquo, Tosin Martins, Olufunmi, Wura Samba, Johnny Drille, Pita, Wole Oni, and the Lagos Mainland Choir among others. The second was in 2017, and saw the introduction of three landmark music initiatives — Mass Appeal, Learn to Play, and Street Studio — and an increase in the number of concert venues to 12. A statement issued by the Chief Operating Officer, Showgear, Adeola Akinyemi states that for this year’s event, the MML crew is upping the ante with a full slate of events across the month of June. Headliners include, King Sunny Ade, Daddy Showkey, Adewale Ayuba, Omawumi, Bez, Sound Sultan, Morayo Music and Folabi Nuel. “We are excited to be back for a third edition of Make Music Lagos following the success and the overwhelming show of support from the last two editions. More importantly, we are excited about the endorsement of the festival by the Lagos State Government, which is a big seal of approval on the festival.” On the music initiatives, Akinyemi explained that the Mass Appeal is a live performance by a diverse group of instrumentalists and bands of the MML 2018, while Learn to DJ or Learn to Play, is a teaching initiative that gives aspiring DJs the opportunity to learn from renowned DJ Jimmy Jatt and other leading DJs. “The Street Studio, is a free style music production initiative that will hold on the World Music Day, June 21, in select locations across the city, adding that the theme song composed by Alternate Sound, Akinyemi said, comes up on Sunday, June 17, at the newly opened Johnson Jakande Tinubu (JJT) Park, Alausa,” Akinyemi added. According to the show promoter, over 16 concerts would hold on World Music Day in various venues across the state, while the celebrations will climax with a Lagos shutdown on Sunday, June 24, at the Muri Okunola Park, Victoria Island with live performances from the masked one, Lagbaja and Waje among others. Akinyemi urged Lagosians to make it a date, as the events are all free, meaning that prospective guests do not have to pay to attend or perform at any of the events. However, all performers and attendees at select events need to pre-register. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
