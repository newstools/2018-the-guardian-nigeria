Ahead of this year’s Future Award Africa, the Future Project (TFP) is set to hold the fourth edition of The Nigeria Symposium for Young and Emerging Leaders on May 31, at the Muson Centre, Onikan, Lagos. Themed Shaping New Narratives, the Symposium will bring together leaders and influential personalities in politics, business, advocacy, media, and more – to engage and discuss issues of governance, public policies, and civic engagement. As an annual knowledge-exchange and mentorship event between present and emerging leaders in government and the public sector to facilitate learning and youth inclusiveness, the event provides a platform for young Nigerians to engage public officials on democratic institutions and national development. In a statement released by The Future Project, Chief Operating Officer, Bukonla Adebakin, spoke on its drive to change negative narratives about Nigeria while highlighting the role of the Nigerian youth in demanding for better governance and improvement in the system of leadership. “In strengthening leadership and citizen participation, it is important that we provide platforms to aid true transformation and establish democratic values while developing active and empowered citizens. With the theme Shaping New Narrative, we intend to highlight the crucial role of citizens in imperatives of open governance,” Adebakin said. The Future Project has a mandate to build empowered citizens across Africa through inclusive enterprise and active citizenship. This focus on Human Capital Development is informed by our value proposition: Africa’s growth needs a generation of young people who are gainfully employed and able to demand and secure better leadership. Projects include Aiki.ng, an employability portal presented with Microsoft; the Nigeria Symposium for Young & Emerging Leaders, #StartupsAfrica, Intern4Jobs, YMonitor.org presented with National Endowment for Democracy (NED), The Future Enterprise Support Scheme and The Future Awards Africa, described as ‘The Nobel Prize for Young Africans’. Founded by the Chude Jideonwo and Adebola Williams, TFP is supervised by a Global Board of Advisors drawn from Africa, Europe, North America and the Middle East, including the Coordinating Minister of the Nigerian Economy, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala; Senior Economic Advisor with the Open Society Foundations, Dr. Obiageli Ezekwesili; co-founder of ONE, Jamie Drummond and the Chief of Cabinet with the Africa Development Bank, Anne Kabagambe.
