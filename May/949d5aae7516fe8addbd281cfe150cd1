This week, people around the world, especially in the music scene, got to know that role models are really just humans. They can either disappoint or be a source of inspiration. From girls getting high-end cars to racist comments, here is what went down in our week. Rapper Kanye West has been in the news, but not for his music. The rapper, never shy about expressing himself, has been making quite a lot of controversial statements as he promotes two upcoming albums. West, a known supporter of Donald Trump, complained that his anger with Jay Z was for not attending his wedding. However, the comment that sparked fresh outrage was him saying that ‘slavery is a choice’. Speaking with TMZ Live, the broadcast wing of the celebrity gossip site, West said, “You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.” Kanye West. Photo: Vanity Fair? Smash or hit? Facebook is getting into the dating scene with a new dating feature. This was announced by Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, at the annual F8 Developer Conference, California. “This is going to be for building real, long-term relationships — not just for hookups. We have designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning. Your friends aren’t going to see your profile, and you’re only going to be suggested to people who are not your friends.” It will also have a clear history feature which will allow users to see which apps and websites send the network information, delete the data from their account, and prevent Facebook from storing it.
