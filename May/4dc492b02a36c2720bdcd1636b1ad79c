  The Chairman of the Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited (ASCL) branch of ISSAN, Salami Momoh Jimoh, who stated this recently on the sideline of the May Day celebration in Lokoja, called for revival of the complex before its concession to investors. He said: “ASLC is the largest steel industry in the entire Africa and the 3rd largest in the world. It is an integrated plant whereby you start a process and you end it within the complex in Ajaokuta without taking it out. “So the ASCL has a lot of advantages if the Federal Government can have that political will and complete the project in no distant time.” He commended the Speaker of the House of Representatives; Hon. Yakubu Dogara for his timely intervention when he visited the complex and stated that the House would not fold its hands and allow the company to be concessioned for the second time.
