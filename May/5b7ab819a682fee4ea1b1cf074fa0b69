 Kashimawo Laloko  Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Laloko stated that the friendly encounter between Atletico Madrid and Super Eagles Team B at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo was a delight to watch. While praising the visiting Atletico team for presenting top quality players in the game, Laloko stated that the Super Eagles Team B had players who are capable of ruling the world of football in the nearest future. “Atletico Madrid have good players, but I must say that the Super Eagles Team B need more friendly matches. The result of the match is a good one for the Eagles to start with. The Super Eagles Coach Salisu Yusuf needs to do more on the team, especially in organising the players. If that is done, I see the boys conquering the World in the nearest future. Football is a terrible game because no one can predict what will happen or who will win a game,” Laloko stated. He urged the coach not to leave any stone unturned in making sure that some of the players who featured in the game against Atletico Madrid make the Super Eagles squad for the World Cup in Russia.Laloko however stated that the team does not have a good goalkeeper and organized defence, advising that all loop holes in the team should be worked on for a better result in the future.
