Marriage and children and thankfully, that’s what I am getting! Yay! Who says you can’t have it all? God is amazing! — Linda Ikeji (@lindaikeji) May 21, 2018  That is not all. She wrote in a series of tweets (now deleted) why she got pregnant. “I preached celibacy to young girls because I feel that’s the right way to live until you meet someone very special that you love and who loves you and wants to be in a committed relationship with you. Passing body around and having multiple partners is not the way and I stand by it. “And I’ve lived by it. But then I turned 36 and I knew there was nothing else I wanted more than to be a mum & wife and celibacy wasn’t going to get me that! I even did a video talking about how much I wanted these two things and God has finally answered my prayers. Beyond blessed.” Do you think she owes anyone an explanation for what she does with her private life?
