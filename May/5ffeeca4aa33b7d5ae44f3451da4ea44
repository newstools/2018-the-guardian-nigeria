A Federal Capital Territory High Court has sentenced a former Taraba State governor, Jolly Nyame, to 14 years in prison without an option of fine. Nyame was arraigned on a four-count-charge of receiving gratification, obtaining public funds without due consideration, criminal breach of trust and gratification. The judge, Adebukola Banjoko, gave the verdict after he found Nyame guilty of misappropriation and misapplication of N165 million with dishonest intention and misappropriation of public funds to the tune of N250 million. Delivering the judgment, Justice Adebukola Banjoko said that the money earlier seized by the EFCC from the convict should be returned to the government treasury. Banjoko said the convict, being a clergyman, should have lived up to his calling. She said that facts before the court showed that the convict had encouraged other government officials in Taraba during his regime to engage in reckless misappropriations. The judge, however, said she was moved by the plea of leniency by counsel to the convict but was morally outraged with the facts of the case to grant such plea. “There is no moral justification for the level of outright theft and the court will be failing in its responsibility if it does not impose punishment to serve as a deterrent,’’ Banjoko said.
