Instagram finally added a feature everyone wanted badly! Photo Credit: Highsnobiety Instagram has announced a new update, which allows users to mute people without unfollowing them. This new feature allows users to remove someone’s post or stories from appearing on their home screen or timeline but still allows them to view the muted person’s profile. Instagram said in a blog post,” The accounts you mute will not be aware that you’ve muted them.” Therefore, you can always unmute unwanted users and see their posts or stories on your home screen again. This feature has been available on other social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp for a while now. Instagram says it could be a helpful feature for “managing complex social dynamics.” Whether you are muting your friends with boring, upsetting or intimidating posts, they will have no idea you muted them. Thank you, Instagram, for blessing our timeline with this update.
