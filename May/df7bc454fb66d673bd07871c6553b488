 President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief John Nwodo  They made the call yesterday when they visited the Senate in Abuja and said they were unhappy with what they called, gross deterioration in governance resulting in endless spate of killings, disregard for the rule of law and contempt for the legislature. The leaders decried the increasing disunity along ethnic, religious and regional lines in the country. They expressed concern that lopsided appointments of persons into key positions had worsened the situation. Ohanaeze leader, John Nwodo, who presented the position of the leaders to the Senate leadership, lamented the decline in the economy due to serious disorders in the functioning of government. He said a restructured Nigeria anchored on devolution of power and functional fiscal federalism is the only way out of the crises bedeviling the nation. According to him, a systemic dysfunction is the worst of all the problems confronting the country. He explained that the countryâ€™s problems emanated from the Constitution, as being presently run in the country, as against the ones operated between 1954 and 1966. The leaders declared that they had watched the helplessness of the National Assembly where members of the executive even refuse its invitations.
