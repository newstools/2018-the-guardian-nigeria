The theme of the Students Mentorship Summit (SMS) is “Making the certificate practical.” The summit tagged ‘Anambra 2018,’ is the second in the series, and is targeted at stimulating intellectual discourse to restore the lost glory in education system. It will hold on June 1, 2018, at the Dora Akunyili Development Centre, Awka. It is also to chart a roadmap for a glorious future in the sector. According to the statement, the event will feature professionals from diverse backgrounds. It said participants would brainstorm on the need for education managers to place premium on education. This, the statement added, is panacea to restoring the lost dignity of certification in Nigeria. The summit will also feature lectures, interactive sessions, career guidance mentorship, motivation talk and follow-ups. It is also targeted at changing the narratives of the “proverbial half-baked graduates.” This term refers to graduates, whose only evidence of having been to school is the possession of laminated certificates. The statement expressed concern about the situation that has made some persons to claim the knowledge they never acquired.
