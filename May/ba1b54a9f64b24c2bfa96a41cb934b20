  Besides, Sani also said that he would soon officially decamp from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to one of the opposition parties where he will vie for the post to challenge El-Rufai. The senator, who spoke in an interview at the weekend, said the attacks and killings by Boko Haram insurgents and Fulani herdsmen would affect the political fortune of the APC during the presidential and governorship elections in many states. According to him: “It was very clear that the results of the recently-conducted local council elections in Kaduna State did not reflect what happened. Even, there was no ward congress in the state; they just wrote list of names and submitted and this situation has worsened the internal crisis among those who used their money to buy forms. “Let it be known to Governor El-Rufai that I am contesting against him in 2019 governorship election in the state. The election will not be conducted by the state electoral commission.
