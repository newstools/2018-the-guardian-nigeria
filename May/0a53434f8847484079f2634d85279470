Overload features a rhythmic beat that adopts the dark Southern African drum pattern mixed with the warm bounce of original Nigerian melodies. For London Town, click here Production duo Da Beatfreakz provide a hard beat that features a heavyweight verse from Giggs and sees Mr. Eazi switch his style from laidback melodies to hard flows with back to back bars. This switch perfectly echoes the culture shifts from Lagos to London. These singles, his first release since signing a label licensing deal recently with Universal Music Group Africa, are influenced by the close trans-Atlantic relationship between Lagos and London with London Town capturing the essence of London from a Nigerian’s perspective whilst Overload captures the essence of Nigerians in London and the journey to get there.
