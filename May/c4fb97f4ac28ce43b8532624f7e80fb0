 Governor Akinwunmi Ambode  Ogusanya, who came from a polygamous family, had during his valedictory speech narrated how he inherited cataract from his father and how he had the first unsuccessful surgery and then the second, which was successful. According to him, he did not only suffer inferiority complex as a result of the eye disease, but also failed his WAEC/NECO examination woefully. He also recalled how he spent extra three years at home because of the cataract. “I eventually had a successful surgery at University College Hospital, Ibadan, before re-sitting for WAEC and gaining admission into LASU. I wanted to study Accounting but at that time the course was not accredited and Business Administration was available so I had to grab it, and today, see where that impromptu decision has brought me.” Chancellor of the institution and Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Justice Adesola Oguntade, urged the graduands to be part of solution that would change the nation’s narratives, charging them to put the knowledge they have acquired to good use as they proceed to the next chapter of their lives. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, on his part, remarked that LASU has received several accolades academically from notable organisations, adding that the institution is determined to continually add value to the state.
