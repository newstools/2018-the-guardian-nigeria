Three hundred and twelve rape and defilement cases are presently being tried at different high courts across Delta State, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Peter Mrakpor, has disclosed. Mrakpor, who spoke with journalists in Asaba yesterday, said there are 29 cases of kidnapping and 17 murder cases at the state high courts. He added that over 100 people, mostly youths between the ages of 16 and 25 are also awaiting trial at the five prisons in the state. He noted that the state created the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) “to ensure victims of rape and domestic violence receive holistic free medical attention, counseling, rehabilitations and other support services while five convictions were secured in respect of sexual-related cases.” Amidst laughter, the Justice Commissioner said he personally settled a case of a Redeemed pastor whose marriage was at the verge collapse with a pot of soup. He said: “The couple came to me and I advised them to be more united in their marriage after which I gave them money to cook and eat and after that, they have been living happily.” On cultism, the Attorney General said the number of youths involved in cult activities was worrisome, revealing that most cultists come from separated homes and those whose parents are cultists. Mrakpor added that the state received nine petitions in respect of domestic violence, aggressive or behaviour within the home, but six of it has been resolved.
