This followed its allegation that Governor Yahaya Bello has hijacked the party’s machinery to manipulate the party in his favour. According to him, the governor’s handing over of the process to his local government administrators, has further alienated the party’s leadership in the state. Meseko also accused the APC national leadership of failing to unite the factions in the state. He said: “We learnt on good authority that very harmful weapons would be deployed at the various venues to keep us away from participating, so it is better for us not to put ourselves in danger.” Read More: Assurances of fairness as Ekiti APC guber primaries hold Meseko explained that the Audu, Faleke group has not been carried along in the party’s affairs, despite that it cooperated with the Tony Momoh-led reconciliation committee that the national leadership had raised. He said: “The governor frustrated the whole process, and the outcome of the panel did not see the light of the day. “Not satisfied, the National Working Committee (NEC) of the party again set up another high-powered panel, headed by Gen. Idris Garba,” which it claimed also failed. The group warned that the Senator Dino Melaye’s failed recall process was a signal of what the future holds for the party in the state.
