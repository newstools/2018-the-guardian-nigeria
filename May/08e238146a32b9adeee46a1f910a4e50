 Dakuku Peterside, NIMASA Boss  Director-General, NIMASA, Dakuku Peterside, who gave the counsel when the Nigerian Fellowship of Christian Seafarers (NFCS), paid him a courtesy visit, said rather than display religious fervour, they should instead let their way of life do the evangelism. Peterside expressed deep pleasure that there are Christian seafarers, and expressed the hope that the association could join in the efforts to sanitise the maritime industry. He said: “We are hoping that Christian seafarers can join government to stem the tide of negativity. We hope you can also positively influence other practitioners in the industry. I believe you are aware that Jesus Christ himself was a seafarer. He was always on a boat, preaching and in fact had to calm stormy waters. We pray that you will follow his example.” Peterside told them that the agency and indeed the government need their prayers and support, while assuring them of NIMASA’s support in areas of training and welfare.

Oyetunde pledged that “a new crop of seafarers are emerging and therefore a brand new industry is in view. I have come to tell you that the Nigeria maritime industry shall be rebuilt and the glory of the latter shall be greater than the former. I announce that her fortunes shall be restored, and therefore stand in its rightful place among the comity of nations. The future of this industry is beautiful, I see Eden in front, and it is a new dawn,” Oyetunde predicted. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
