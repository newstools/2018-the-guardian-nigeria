Sibongile Mani PHOTO: DESTINYMAN.COM A South African student who splurged more than $63,000 of $1.1 million she erroneously received was arrested on Tuesday and appeared in court for alleged theft, police said. Sibongile Mani, 28, was arrested by the policeâ€™s serious commercial crime unit after she was asked to turn herself in, Anelisa Feni, spokeswoman for an elite police unit, the Hawks, told AFP. Mani, a student at Walter Sisulu University in Eastern Cape province, appeared before a magistrate court on charges of theft. She qualified last year for 1,400-rand ($110) in monthly food allowances from the National Students Financial Aid Scheme, which aids underprivileged students. Instead, she was accidentally given $1.1 million in June and went on a spending spree, splurging on expensive clothing, a smartphone and partying. It took the scheme three months to detect the error. It recovered the remainder of the funds from her bank account. Mani was released on a warning and ordered to appear again on July 2.
