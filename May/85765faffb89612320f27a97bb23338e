Cambodia satisfies the urge anyone looking to viewing ancient ruins has. It plays host to some smaller towns and villages that provide a chance to experience a more traditional way of life, including treks into the jungle and a sight of fascinating ancient ruins like the famous site of Angkor, which offers a chance to see temples unrivalled in scale and grandeur in southeast Asia. Here are some of the best places to experience what Cambodia has to offer: The former capital of the Khmer Empire is bursting with historic treasures. You can find ruins of temples all over the huge palace, some of which have been restored, including the Buddhist Ta Prohm temple which is entwined with towering trees, the Bayon temple with its many massive stone faces and the Angkor Wat temple which is currently the world’s largest single religious monument. Once known as the “pearl of Asia” the capital is considered one of the most beautiful cities which were built by the French. Although it is still recovering from war and revolution, the large city has different tourist attractions including the National Museum and the Royal Palace. You can check out a large collection of Khmer artefacts or visit the night market for handcrafted items or souvenirs. This remote temple was once the capital of the Khmer empire. The site has the Prasat Thom, a 98-foot tall temple pyramid that rises high above the other spectacular buildings and immense structures in it, and the surrounding jungle. Once Cambodia’s most inaccessible temple destinations, Koh Ker has become a must-visit location for tourists in Cambodia.
