  He said federal might also played a crucial role in the loss of the governorship seat to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Wada, speaking at a luncheon and award ceremony organised by Forum of Former PDP Members of Kogi State House of Assembly on Friday in Lokoja, said rather than non-performance, his administration suffered communication problems, as its good intentions were misconstrued. “We must ensure that we put forward people of unquestionable character. We must unite behind whoever wins the primary and must not allow elections to divide us. The people have now realised the meaning of non-performance, when compared to the present government of propaganda,” he said. Another former governor, Alhaji Ibrahim Idris, also said: “We are confident that PDP will return to power in the state next year, judging by the enthusiasm with which party members gathered here today. It shows we are ready to return power to the people of the state.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
