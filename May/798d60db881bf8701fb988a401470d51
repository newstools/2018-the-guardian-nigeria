Supporters of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega take part in an official rally against violence, following last week’s protests where at least 43 people were killed, in Managua on May 2, 2018. The protests that erupted on April 18 were the worst faced by Ortega in his last 11 years in power, badly shaking his tight grip on power over the country, one of the poorest in Latin America. / AFP PHOTO / INTI OCON Riot police blocked young Nicaraguan demonstrators who were back on the streets Wednesday to demand justice over the deaths of 43 people in anti-government unrest. “Let us through!
