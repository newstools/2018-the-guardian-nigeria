This week’s episode of the of MTV Base Official Naija Top Ten countdown witnessed some reshuffling, as Buzzin`g street-hop artiste and Legbegbe crooner, Mr. Real, who hit the naija music scene in the last quarter of 2017 off the wave of the shaku-shaku, made appearance on the show. It was not all a good week for Starboy Records chief, Wizkid, as his Soco hit, which had been on the number one spot for four weeks, took a fall to the second spot, making room for Davido’s Assurance. Wizkid’s fall to the second spot also caused Mayorkun’s Bobo to make a decline to the third spot, while Kiss Daniel with his 4Dayz moved to number four spot from last week’s number three. In the same twist, DJ Enimoney, whose Diet featuring Tiwa Savage, Reminisce, Slimcase moved one step up from number six spot to number five, just as Timaya’s brand new hit, Ah Blem Blem moved from number 10 to number six. Also suffering fall like Wizkid on the week’s episode of countdown was the guest artiste on the show, Mr. Real, whose Legbegbe nose-dived from number four spot to number seven.
DJ Spinall’s duet with Wizkid, Nowo suffered similar fate on the chart, moving number five last week to number eight this week, even as Tiwa Savage’s Get It Now (Remix) featuring American star, Omarion moved from number seven to number nine.    ‘Sky Level’ master, Patoranking, made another entry with his brand new release single, Suh Different, which made a debut on number 10 spot. 1.
