When you see someone for the first time, what do you notice first about them? Their smile? Their eyes? The wrinkles on their face? Perhaps their elaborate tribal marks? Well…according to a study published by USA Today, a majority of us notice the teeth first when meeting new people. The whiter the teeth, the better. No one wants yellow teeth but sadly, not everyone can afford regular expensive dental treatments. However, there are a few things you can do on your own to get whiter teeth without buying expensive products or going through special procedures or routines. If you want to brighten your smile, try doing these three little things for whiter teeth. Photo credit: Pinterest A diet high in fruits and vegetables may be good for both your body and your teeth.
While they are no substitute for brushing your teeth, fruits and vegetables can help remove plaque as you chew. In particular, strawberries and pineapple are two fruits that have been claimed to help whiten your teeth.

Simply wet your toothbrush in 1/8 teaspoon turmeric powder, brush as normal, and then allow the powder to sit on your teeth for 3-5 minutes before rinsing. Then brush with your normal toothpaste as usual. Photo Credit: Getty Images While some tooth discolouration comes naturally with age, it is largely a result of plaque build-up. Regular brushing and flossing can help your teeth stay white by reducing bacteria in your mouth and preventing plaque build-up.
Toothpaste gently rubs out stains on your teeth, and flossing removes bacteria that lead to plaque. Other Speculated ways to whiten teeth:
• Activated charcoal: Brushing with powdered charcoal supposedly removes toxins and stains from the mouth and teeth.
• Fruit peels: Rubbing orange, lemon or banana peels on your teeth is claimed to make them whiter.
