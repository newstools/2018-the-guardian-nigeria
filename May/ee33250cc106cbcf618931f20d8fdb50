The White House announced that Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure on May 14, 2018, to treat a benign kidney condition at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The procedure was successful and there were no complications, according to a statement from the Office of the First Lady. JIM WATSON / AFP US First Lady Melania Trump had surgery on Monday for what aides called a “benign” kidney condition, and will remain in hospital for the rest of the week. The Slovenia-born wife of Donald Trump underwent an embolization procedure, said her communications director Stephanie Grisham. “The procedure was successful and there were no complications,” Grisham said, adding that the 48-year-old former model is expected to stay in hospital “for the duration of the week.” “The First Lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere.” Embolization is most often used to cut the blood supply to a cancerous or non-cancerous tumor. Trump is being kept at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just north of Washington, where many presidents and first families have received treatment. Her president husband is expected to visit the hospital soon. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
