The UK has now made divorce easier through its online divorces in England and Wales. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) informed the public that digital divorce applications can now be accessed starting May. This new form removes the stress of paper forms and includes simple and clear language. Other processes such as payment and supporting evidence can be done online. The MoJ staff, at the moment, spend 13,000 hours on paper forms. The Minister of Justice Lucy Frazer said: “Allowing divorce applications to be made online will help make sure we are best supporting people going through an often difficult and painful time. “More people will have the option of moving from paper-based processes to online systems which will cut waste, speed up services which can be safely expedited, and otherwise better fit with modern day life.” This change is coming in line as a part of the £1 billion programme (N503,300,000,000.00) to improve the court system.
