 Multichoice Nigeria  The proposed pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme, would charge users according to their effective resource consumption excluding interference. John Ugbe, managing director of Multichoice Nigeria, who spoke on the side-lines of the ongoing Digital Dialogue in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, said that “pay-as-you-consume is something we may consider, if it is technologically possible and the business model supports it, we will” He said that the company currently allows subscribers to suspend their subscriptions twice a year in case they are not of Africa. It would be recalled that most pay TV providers, had consistently argued that the model was not possible to implement in Nigeria on the grounds that they bought the contents they relay as a whole and not in bits. If DStv goes ahead with the plan, they will replicate the revolutionary feat Globacom made in the telecoms industry through the introduction of per second billing (PSB). Prior to the implementation of PSB by Glo, MTN and Econet (now Airtel) had insisted that it was not possible to operate the PSB until after seven years, but Glo made it possible immediately it hit the market in 2003.
