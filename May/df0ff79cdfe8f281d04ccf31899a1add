Are the effects of Kanye’s Remark on slavery finally coming to play? His brand YEEZY collaborated with Australian sportswear brand 2XU and there was a whole debut set up at a 2XU store in Sydney.

But after 45-minutes and customers failing to show, the store shut down the event.

These products had been hyped and publicised on social media by the rapper’s wife Kim Kardashian and a press release had stated that “fans will have to be quick, with a strictly limited number of pieces from the collection available to the public.” Kim Kardashian.
