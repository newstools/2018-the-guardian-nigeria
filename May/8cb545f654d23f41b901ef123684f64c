Canadian police on Friday launched a hunt for two men who staged an explosion in an Indian restaurant near Toronto that injured 15 people. An improvised device detonated Thursday night in the eatery in Mississauga, a big urban area west of Toronto, CBC said. Three of the injured were in critical condition, officials said. Two males with their faces covered entered the Bombay Bhel restaurant, dropped some sort of explosive device and fled, said Peel Region Sergeant Matt Bertram. "We have no indication to call it a hate crime or any kind of terrorism act," Bertram said, cited by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The attackers didn't say anything, he said. "It appears they just went in, dropped off this device, and took off right away." To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
