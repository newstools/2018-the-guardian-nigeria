  Besides, he announced that the Federal Government has approved N10 billion for fast rehabilitation of all affected communities in all states of the federation. Osinbajo, who gave the assurance yesterday while on tour of IDP camps at Agbagana in Makurdi and Daudu in Guma Local councils of Benue State, said this action would start as soon as possible so that the ravaged farmers would begin their new lives again. According to him: “Your destroyed homes by herdsmen attacks will be built better than what there were. This is going to be done to you, not as a favour, but as a right that has to be given to you by government as citizens of this country.” Osinbajo, who said his visit to Benue State was to represent President Muhammadu Buhari, advised people of the state to organise themselves into co-operative societies and other groups to benefit from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) anchored borrowers scheme and micro-finance scheme for small businesses. Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom, who appreciated the President and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for their concern for the plight of the people in Benue IDP camps, commended the Federal Government for the support so far.
