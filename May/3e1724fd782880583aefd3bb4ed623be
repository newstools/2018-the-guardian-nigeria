On this day, 37 years ago, one of the greatest musicians that the world has ever seen, Bob Marley, passed away. Nesta Robert Marley was born on February 6, 1945, on his grandfather’s farm in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish to a British father and Jamaican mother. He started out with a group Wailers who would later rise to fame. While there, he created his own style which was a fusion of reggae, ska and rocksteady. By the time the group broke up in 1974, he relocated to England where he released his solo album Exodus in 1977. This album led the Rastafari’s rise to international prominence. In 1977, he was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma. In 1978, he also released another album Kaya. In 1980, he performed to over 100,000 people in Milan and released an album Uprising. After eight months of unsuccessfully treating his sickness, he returned to Jamaica and died in 1981 at the age of 36. He was never shy about his religious beliefs and this reflected in some of his songs. His album released in 1983 Confrontation is considered his most religious album. Three years after his death, the best-selling reggae album of all time Legend (1984) was released.
