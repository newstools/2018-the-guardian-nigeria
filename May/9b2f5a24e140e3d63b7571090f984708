Life business marked the overall improved performance, growing 15% from N18.8 billion in 2016 to N21.6 billion in 2017. This growth was driven by the increased popularity of traditional life products – which grew by 29% in 2017 to N16.4 billion from N12.8 billion in 2016. Non-life business also experienced improved performance – growing from N7.6 billion in 2016 to N8.7 billion in 2017, (c. N1.1 billion or 15%). Last year, AIICO Insurance focused on further improving its relationships with agents, brokers & various intermediaries, and the significant growth the company experienced has been a result of this forward-thinking strategy.
