Nigeriaâ€™s great music export, Wizkid is excited for good reason. The songwriter and singer landed the airport in the United Kingdom and was overwhelmed when he was greeted by his baby Zion Balogun with his manager and third baby mama, Jada Pollock. The boy is his third child and we admit, he shares a striking resemblance with Asaad. See who came to pick Dad frm the airport ! A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on May 10, 2018 at 3:19pm PDT
