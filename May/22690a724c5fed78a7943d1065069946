Ask yourself, Is your skin a reflection of a healthy body? Exposure to the sun, lifestyle, food, and stress may cause the skin to age prematurely resulting in uneven skin tones, dark circles, acne, pigmentation, age spots, wrinkles and fine lines. Besides exercising regularly, having enough sleep and a good diet, there are other remedies that have been proven to slow down the ageing process leaving the skin looking beautiful and young. One of such discoveries is the Murad Method Treatment. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-645233 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg.png" alt="" width="1031" height="866" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg.png 1031w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg-712x598.png 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg-487x409.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg-974x818.png 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg-286x240.png 286w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg-571x480.png 571w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Picture2.jpg-600x504.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1031px) 100vw, 1031px" /> The Murad Method is a specialised treatment that includes spa sessions, DIY home remedies, a diet plan to create and maintain beauty in different ways.
