Managing Director, MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe, said the need to shift attention to the creative industry was vital, as the continent’s development had long been defined by investment in other industries, thereby neglecting the creative industry’s potential. “As a result, the film and television industries have not developed at the same pace as other industries on the continent, and not for a lack of talent, passion or imagination. “We are abundantly blessed in these areas. However, the space given for this expression has at best been limited and at worst, been relegated to the fringes of the mainstream economy, leaving in its wake, unfulfilled dreams, unexplored talent and unwritten stories,” he said. The MTF initiative would deliver three touch points throughout the year, the MTF academies; Master Classes and the MTF Portal. The first to launch is the MTF Academy, a 12-month educational programme aimed at furnishing 60 deserving, young and talented people who want to work and innovate in film and television production. MTF Academy Director for West Africa, Femi Odugbemi, said: “We must consciously build capacity so that our next-generation filmmakers and producers can also create wealth and create employment by being entrepreneurs as well.” Application for the MTF is now open and would close on July 5, 2018. The 60 post-school MTF students, 20 for each region, would be selected from 13 African countries. The year-long programme begins on October 1, 2018.
