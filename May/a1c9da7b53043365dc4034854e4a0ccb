SAEON MORUDA has released Adura – a brand new song from her highly anticipated new mixtape album Birth Of The Boy Chick (BOTBC). The new record arrives about 2 months after SAEON MORUDA released Rebirth, the lead single which made an impressive debut on Factory 78 UK Top 10 ‘Pick of The Week’, entering at #4.  The new single is a groovy trap song produced by Sess The PRBLM Kid (who also has his backing vocals in the hook) and finds SAEON MORUDA owning up to her applaudable rap/singing skills as she candidly talks about experiences that have shaped her as an individual and as an artist.  “Back when I was in high school Ma hommie Sappy told me I was controversial // I never gave it a thought but now I think about it, voicing outta control that ain’t ever the way to go // So uncontrollable, misunderstood and cos was unblameable, I never saw it from your point of view till I had Banky W tell me I needed to change!” She raps.
