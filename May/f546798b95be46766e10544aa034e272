Salisu Yusuf Super Eagles Team B yesterday lost 2-3 to the resilient Atlético Madrid in the maiden edition of the GOtv MAX Cup held at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo. Kelechi Nwakali and Usman Mohammed scored for the Nigerian side after Atletico’s keeper, Jan Oblak, had denied Samad Kadiri earlier in the third minute of the game. The Europa champion then turned the heat on the Nigerian side, as Angel Correa attempts at goal were saved by Eagles goalkeeper, Femi Thomas, on two occasions. Fernando Torres, who came in as substitute almost scored a goal, as Thomas denied him scoring opportunity. Atletico continued the attack to put the Eagles’ defence under pressure. The Salisu Yusuf-tutored side later caved in to pressure from the Spanish side as Torres, who was the main tormentor, provided a clinical finish to the corner of the Eagles net. Eagles equaliser came through Mohammed after Tosin Omoyele gave him a pass, and the Nigerian made a solo run to put the ball behind the net. Atletico’s Borja then scored the third goal that put the match beyond the hard-fighting Nigeria side. Speaking after the encounter, Coach Salisu Yusuf said the Eagles lost to a vastly experienced side. “My boys played very well, but lost to a very experienced side that just won the Europa trophy. The boys did their best but Atletico showed why they are a tough side in Europe,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
