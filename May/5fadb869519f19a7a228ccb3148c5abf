Today is yet another Mother’s Day and, by now, we’re sure you are more than confused on how many times we celebrate this day in a year. But, this is the last one (we think). The best gift you can ever give to your mother is your company in the midst of some good food. For this special Sunday, we have curated a list out of the many restaurants we’ve reviewed in the past, to create the ultimate Mother’s day experience. Located at Musa Yaradua, VI, Lagos is La Brioche. This French-inspired bistro is the perfect intimate start to the day. The beautifully decorated, white space has a selection of French pastries while giving off that “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” vibe. Without doing much damage to your wallet, you can order a healthy plate from buttermilk pancakes to their classic breakfast menu options. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-631759 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/A5E20B12-5A57-4599-8ACE-F8C41A4AD0DF.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/A5E20B12-5A57-4599-8ACE-F8C41A4AD0DF.jpeg 720w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/A5E20B12-5A57-4599-8ACE-F8C41A4AD0DF-487x325.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/A5E20B12-5A57-4599-8ACE-F8C41A4AD0DF-320x213.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/A5E20B12-5A57-4599-8ACE-F8C41A4AD0DF-640x427.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/A5E20B12-5A57-4599-8ACE-F8C41A4AD0DF-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Not everyday jollof rice, sometimes seafood! Every lover of seafood knows that the place to be is Ocean Basket located at Plot 1392, Tiamiyu Savage Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. The South African restaurant has a menu packed with a variety of seafood surprises. We recommend starting off your seafood experience with the starter of garlic bread and scampi with sweet chilli sauce. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-631761 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8.jpeg 1024w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8-797x598.jpeg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8-320x240.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8-640x480.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8-487x365.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8-974x731.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FBC09AED-FD98-4B06-8C60-AC9E78889BF8-600x450.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Nothing screams “I love you” like having an Italian meal at the end of the day and La Veranda is just the place to share with your mum for dinner. Opt for seating inside as the weather these days is as sporadic as Donald Trump’s tweets. This restaurant is located at Blowfish Hotel No17, Ojun Ologbun street, off Bishop Oluwole Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. It will have you feeling all modern as you have the menu options on a tab. Try the Spaghetti Vittoria or the Mama Roma Italian pizza to end an already perfect day. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-631763 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629.jpeg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-640x360.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-1062x598.jpeg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-320x180.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-281x158.jpeg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-562x316.jpeg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-531x299.jpeg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-487x274.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-974x548.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6625F21F-0BC5-4C9F-998F-48C7DE1DF629-600x338.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
