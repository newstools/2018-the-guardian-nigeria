According to Prof. Akintoye, there are big problems of governance and economy, which needed urgent attention of the elders. He said: “We are elders. Most of us are not active politicians. We have come together because we are worried about the condition of our country. Things are not well with our country. A lot of things are happening in our country that ordinarily should not happen. Ours is a land of promise, a land well endowed by nature with a lot of wealth but we are not using the wealth to enrich our people. Instead, we are going down, down and down in terms of prosperity and progress. “So, we have decided to work together - that is the most important thing because the problems are many.’’ To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
