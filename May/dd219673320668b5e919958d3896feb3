 Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar of Bauchi State  The spokesman to the former deputy governor was quoted as saying that Gidado resigned because he was not being treated as part of the government.The governor, however, dismissed the allegation, saying that his former deputy was fairly treated while in service.“I think he is wrong. Go to the House of Assembly and check, I went on official leave twice since I took over and each time I transmitted a letter to the House of Assembly making him the Acting Governor of the state. “Moreover, I gave him the most important ministry, the Ministry of Education, where I have been allocating the largest share of the budget of the state since 2008,’’ he added.
Abubakar further explained that there was nothing negative that transpired between him and the former deputy governor. He said: “What transpired is in the letter of Gidado, and I think people should read that letter, read the entire letter and you will see that there was nothing bad that transpired between us. His final paragraph is that he remains loyal to his leader and brother. “In my response, I eulogized him and wished him the best in his future endeavour and assured him of the support of the good people of Bauchi State. There was no problem whatsoever.’’ The governor, who had earlier joined President Muhammadu Buhari to perform the Juma’at prayer at the Aso Rock Mosque, said he had `fantastic working relationship’ with the former deputy governor.
