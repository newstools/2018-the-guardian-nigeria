Snoop Dogg is winning in all angles. The musician whose gospel album earned the number 1 spot on Billboard’s Top Gospel Albums, has landed a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for his 145 gallons of paradise cocktail mix, Mercury News reports. The “Gin and Juice” drink which was made up of a massive 180 bottles of Hendricks Gin was mixed at Williams Sonoma Culinary Stage at the Bottlerock Napa Valley Festival, California in a five feet tall and three feet wide glass. His team was made up of Warren G and Michael Voltaggio, Top Chef winner. On the certificate presented to the team, Guinness wrote, “The largest paradise cocktail was created by Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Michael Voltaggio, Kim Kaechele and Kendall Coleman (All USA) in Napa, California, USA on 26 May 2018.” And if you were thinking about what you would call it? It is called Doggystyle after his album of the same name.
