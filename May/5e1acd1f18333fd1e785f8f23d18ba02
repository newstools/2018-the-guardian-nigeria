Gmail has now revamped its interface, adding some clever, new features for users to enjoy. Some of these features include a snooze button for incoming messages, Smart Compose and, for the first time, a brand new support for user mentions, just like Twitter and Slack do.

Gmail will bring up a list of people in your contacts with that name. Choose one of them and it will add a mail to the link labelled with their name. When your recipient, Uju, clicks on that link, it will bring up a new compose window for her to write to Adekunle. It comes in very handy when you need to introduce someone to another contact or quickly list a number of email addresses in a message. But that’s not all this feature does. When you mention someone in your email with a + sign instead of the @ symbol, the contact will automatically be added as a recipient of your message. It makes it easier to send emails properly – quite like the way Gmail reminds you to attach a file when you mention that you’re doing so in the email but don’t have anything attached.

You can turn it on by choosing the option in the menu that pops up when you click the gear icon in the top right of your inbox. Read More: Sony Buys EMI Music Publishing For $1.9bn
