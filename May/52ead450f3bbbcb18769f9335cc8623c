The Guardian gathered that the victim, whose birthday coincided with the day of the incident, went out to celebrate her birthday with friends instead of cooking and when she returned late at night, quarrel broke out with her spouse. A community source disclosed that as the arguments intensified, the couple engaged in a fight and the husband broke a bottle and stabbed the wife on the leg, which resulted to serious bleeding. He said all efforts to save her life failed, as doctors were not present at the hospitals she was taken to. According to the eyewitness, “she was later taken to the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) in Choba, about an hour drive from the earlier clinics around her area, where she was confirmed dead by a doctor on duty. This was corroborated by Tonye David, a resident of the community, where the incident occurred. He said the victim celebrated her birthday on Saturday in the community, and was killed by the father of her children on Sunday morning, during a fight that ensued between them over an argument. It was further gathered that the husband, Ibisaki, on hearing that his wife might not survive the stabbing, submitted himself to the police at Buguma Police Station. The Guardian gathered that the couple had endured several marital crises in the past, which led to their separation, but they later reconciled following the intervention of their families. However, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Nnamdi Omoni, has confirmed the incident, adding that the suspect has been arrested by the police and is aiding in further investigation. Omoni said: “The man is with us now; he has been arrested and helping us in our investigation. He stabbed his wife on her left leg and she later died of bleeding, though he said he did not intend to kill her.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
