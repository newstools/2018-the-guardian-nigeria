He described the problem as “cancerous”, saying it has ridiculed tertiary education in the country. As the nation battles rising drug abuse among youths, he also sounded a note of warning to freshmen, saying any of them caught in the act would be summarily dismissed. Ndubuisi, who spoke at the second matriculation of the school, said: “Public universities have become arenas for strikes and industrial disputes that have almost ridiculed university education. When it is not ASUU, it is NASU or SAANU. Parents and students are weary of this malady that has become a feature and a big cancer in the public universities.” He suggested that stakeholders in the sector should work hard to make strikes a thing of the past in the interest of not only the university system, but also the nation. “Trade unions in the universities and other tertiary institutions must find better and more civil ways and means of resolving their differences,” he said.
