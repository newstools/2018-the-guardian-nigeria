The Rotary International District 9110, Nigeria has completed and handed over to the Lagos State government and Igbogbo-Baiyeku Local Council Development Area (LCDA) a N33 million Rotary Vocational Training Centre at Igbogbo area of Ikorodu. According to the District Governor, Dr. Wale Ogunbadejo, the centre with various departments, which include catering and hotel management, ICT, telephone and computer repairs, fashion designing, cosmetology and gele tying, shoe making and crafts, and music, was financed by Rotary with funds raised during his installation ceremony to the tune of about N26 million, N1 million from the District’s Educational and Welfare Endowment Fund, N5 million from Rotary Foundation representing the district’s grant and the rest donated by some Rotarians. The centre was commissioned by the Commissioner for Physical Planning, Rotimi Ogunleye, who represented Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, and witnessed by the Rotary International President Representative and a member of Rotary Trustee on a visit to Nigeria, Mary Beth Growney Selene. Others at the event were the Adeboruwa of Igbogbo, Oba Semiudeen Kasali, Ojutomoro of Abigi Kingdom, Oba (Rotarian) Olusegun Ogunye, and chairman, Igbogbo-Baiyeku LCDA, Olusesan Daini.
