One of our favourite girls on television is engaged. Taraji Henson, known for her role in Empire Series as Cookie Lyon, got engaged to her boyfriend of two years, Kelvin Hayden on mother’s day. The 47-year-old has been quietly dating the 34-year-old football star. I said yes y’all!!! He started with the Cartier love bracelet BUT that was my #Mothersday gift and then he dropped to his knee and I almost passed out!!! #sheisofficiallyoffthemarket and she is sooooooooooooo HAPPY!!!!!! #GODIS A post shared by  taraji p henson (@tarajiphenson) on May 14, 2018 at 5:29am PDT  The first time the public was made aware of their very private relationship was in December in an interview on Essence‘s podcast. Congratulations girl *in Lucious voice of course*
