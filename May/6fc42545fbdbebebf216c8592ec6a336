The London club had prepared to offer Mikel Arteta the job but have had a change in direction after negotiating a deal with Emery. The decision seems hinged on the experience Emery has compared to Manchester City’s assistant manager, though sources claim Arteta wanted assurances over the role he will play in Arsenal’s transfer policy. Emery flew into London on Monday for negotiations before a unanimous choice of the Spaniard replacing Arsene Wenger at the Emirates. Emery led PSG to a domestic treble before he was let go by the French club. He was replaced by Thomas Tuchel. Before Emery joined PSG, he led Sevilla to a hat-trick of Europa League title between 2014 and 2016. Arsenal have chosen Emery despite his lack of fluency in English with club officials believing that it will not be a barrier.
