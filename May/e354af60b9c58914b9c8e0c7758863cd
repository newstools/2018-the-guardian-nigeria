Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in partnership with International Centre for Energy, Environment and Development (ICEED) has established three fuel-efficient cookstove production centres in Borno State.
 
The centres are located at Jere, Konduga and Maiduguri, aimed at providing training programme for over 100 people on technical and business aspects of fuel-efficient cookstove production across the three local government councils.
 
Launching the centre in Jere, Deputy Country Representative of FAO, Mr. Macki Tall, said the measure was part of a comprehensive programme initiated to reduce dependence on firewood, and provide sustainable livelihood to communities.
 
He observed, people engaged in firewood collection were prone to attacks and abduction by Boko Haram insurgents, while women and children are exposed to eye and respiratory infections through inhalation of harmful firewood smoke.
 
According to him, at least 5,000 locally produced fuel-efficient stoves would be distributed to households with very limited access to firewood, and reduce the amount needed to meet daily cooking need in the three local governments.
 
Earlier, State Commissioner for Environment, Kaka Shehu, stated that forest in the state has been subjected to large-scale degradation due to the strangulation of businesses and economic activities as a result of insurgents over the past years.He noted, this laudable initiative would go a long way in protecting forest resources.
