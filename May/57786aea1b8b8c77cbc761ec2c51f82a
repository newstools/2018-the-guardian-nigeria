The Benin Zonal Command of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Person (NAPTIP) yesterday said it has arrested an unrepentant trafficker who specialises in recruiting young girls for her own children abroad. It said the arrest was made at the weekend.
  
A statement by the Zonal Commander of NAPTIP, Nduka Nwanwene, identified the suspected trafficker as Mrs. Ehis Edoghien (56) from Orhionwon Local Government Area of Edo State. He said the suspect has been on the surveillance of the command after series of reports concerning her activities and that she has been warned several times by neighbours to desist from human trafficking.
   
The statement said in the instant case, the suspect had recruited two young girls and had procured passports and visa to enable them travel to Russia where they will both pay $7,000 each for traveling expenses alone.
  
“The suspect usually takes her victims to her house for some weeks during which they undergo orientation and tutelage before they “graduate” to make the journey. The suspect is also known to take her victims to churches for prayers within the period of the orientation.
  
“In an early morning operation, which led to her arrest, the suspect had taken the two victims to the Life of Christ Fellowship at the Sakponba area of Benin City for prayers—an area very endemic to human trafficking. The suspect fell into the hands of NAPTIP operatives, supported by men of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corp (NSCDC) as soon as she came back from the prayer house.”He said the victims who are about 18 years old were consequently rescued and presently in the NAPTIP shelter for counseling and debriefing.
