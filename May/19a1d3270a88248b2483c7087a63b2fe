 Segun Odegbami  So, like all the countries before it that have hosted the glamorous event, this tiny State was given seven years to perform the daunting task of re-engineering a whole country and fulfil additional secondary national agenda beyond the primary objective of the football that will be played.These past three years the whole of tiny Qatar has become a massive construction site undergoing, probably, the fastest and most ambitious national development project in the Middle East.  Ogun State must combine these essential and invaluable assets, anchor them to this virtual World Cup event that will serve as the catalyst, the facilitator, the enforcing agent and the accelerator, following a defined timeline with set targets and measurable milestones, and a binding covenant with the people of the State (and of Yorubaland) to deliver what will be a model for the region and the country, and the epicenter of a global socio-cultural and economic revolution in the global battle of the Civilisations. 
 
The time for the ascendancy of the Black race from the doldrums of abuse, segregation, disrespect and mental slavery has come.Ogun State will provide the place and platform for that battle, collaborating with, and tapping into, the over 450 Billion US Dollars annual investment portfolio of the most advanced Black community on earth (the African American) who has no inch of soil he can call his homeland in America; our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of our ancestors that were forcefully taken away in slave ships, used for 400 years to build new Civilisations, dumped and declared ‘free’ but still materially and mentally enslaved till now in America. 
 
This is an achievable mission that requires a clarion call, a vision, a political will, a visionary with pedigree, integrity and the intellectual capacity to meander through the minefields of doubt and of lesser minds that will dog the path.Those who have eyes let them see.
