International football star, Ronaldinho (full name: Ronaldo de Assis Moreira), is getting married to his girlfriends, Priscilla Coelho and Beatriz Souza, in an unofficial wedding ceremony, Leo Dias of Brazil’s O Dia newspaper reports. According to the newspaper, the 38-year-old got engaged in January to the both of them and they stay with him as live-in partners. Coincidentally, they will be 30 in August. He was already involved with Coelho when he met Souza in 2016. He is quite generous with the two whom he gives a monthly allowance of £1,500 (N719,722) each. The ceremony will involve close friends and family at their £5m (N2,399,226,637) home in Rio Janeiro.
