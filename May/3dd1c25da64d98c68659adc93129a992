Recently Codeine has been in the news, essentially for the wrong reasons. Codeine which came into use in 1832 has been a very useful medication for treating pain and more recently as a cough suppressant in cough syrups. Codeine or 3-methyl morphine is an alkaloid found in the opium poppy- Papaver somniferum. In 1848, a German Pharmacist discovered how to isolate morphine from the opium poppy, which eventually gave rise to the discovery of Codeine by Pierre Robiquet, a French Chemist in 1832. Subsequently, Codeine was extracted from the black tar opium which constantly put the drug manufacturers in constant conflict with illicit drug cartels, but later was now synthesised from coal-tar. 
 
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Codeine is the most widely and commonly used opiate in the world and is also regarded as the safest of all the opioids and seen as least addictive as well. The most common medical use of codeine is related to its ability to suppress chronic cough, hence it is regarded as an antitussive.    Additionally like other opiates, it helps to reduce nausea and diarrhea and being the weakest opiate, it is used in many of the compounds and will treat these symptoms without causing as many side effects and has a lower probability of physical addiction. Some of the side effects, especially in children include unusual sleepiness, confusion and difficult breathing. In many countries throughout the world, Codeine is regulated by Narcotic control laws, but some countries do allow its purchase over the counter, without a prescription, which as we have seen can readily lead to abuse or addiction.
 
In Nigeria codeine has been freely available either as pain relieving tablets or in cough syrups since early 20th century. It was classified as an over the counter (OTC) product, which meant that you did not need a doctor’s prescription to obtain the product. However, in the last couple of years, following reports of increased abuse of cough syrups containing codeine, the National Agency for Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) reclassified it and made a product that can only be accessed through a doctor’s prescription or pharmacist’s recommendation. Beyond this restriction on consumer access, importation of the product as raw material for manufacturers became controlled and in the last 10 years or so, manufacturers have had to obtain import permit.  Right now the professional community pharmacists are in panic with the rumour that inspectors are going round shops seizing products. And soon, a new grey market for codeine will emerge and begin to flourish. Here, both the good and the bad will mix to create a situation that may be worse than what we are trying to deal with. A nation that cannot prevent the smuggling of arms (AK 47 etc) and cannot stop Muamar-Ghadaffi’s trained soldiers from crossing our borders at will to kill Nigerian citizens cannot stop black-market trade in Codeine from neigbouring countries where sale of cough syrups containing codeine is legal. This official overreach needs to be reviewed for the good of our economy and the right procedure adopted. Most countries have only restricted the use as prescription- only product, only few have gone this road of outright ban. We need to find out the real economic and social factors that are driving some of our populace to drug abuse, addiction and violence and deal with them. Otherwise we may soon ban pit latrines and lizard dung!
