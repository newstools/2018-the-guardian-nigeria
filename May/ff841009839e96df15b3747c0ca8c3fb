Alhaji Ibrahim Shehu Gusau, the President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) • We will make adjustment, says Technical Director
U.S.-based former Nigerian hammer throw champion, Gabriel Opuana, and London-based Olympics medalist, Olusoji Fasuba have called on President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Ibrahim Gusau to resign following the dwindling fortune of the nation’s athletics. Nigeria will host the African Senior Athletics Championship in Asaba, Delta State from August 1 to 5, and Opuana is worried that the AFN is yet to stage a single competition to prepare the athletes for the event. Opuana is also disturbed that Gusau has not been able to bring ‘his broken AFN house’ together one year after he was elected. “Most people who spoke highly of him during his election campaign are now disappointed,” Opuana told The Guardian from his base in the United States of America yesterday. “Many people criticized the former board led by Solomon Ogba, but we have seen the difference. Nothing is happening under this Gusau’s board to keep athletes and their coaches busy. An athlete will train, looking forward to a competition, only to be told that the competition has been postponed. Athletes and coaches are crying due to the way Gusau has chosen to run the federation. Enough is enough. Mr President, please throw in the towel,” Opuana stated. On his part, Fasuba, an Olympics medalist said: “Gusau should resign before he takes Nigerian athletics to a point of no return.” Gusau could not be reached for comments yesterday, but the Technical Director of AFN, Sunday Adeleye, told The Guardian that ‘things will take good shape soon.’ It would be recalled that on two occasions this year, the AFN failed to organize the Golden League, a competition used in putting the athletes in shape for the season.
