Precisely, the Chief Executive Officer of Investdata consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: “We expect a mixed performance for the week as investors digest the numbers to reposition their portfolios in the midst of low valuations, ahead of first quarter economic data and corporate earnings that is coming to an end, especially the Q1 GDP, Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and April inflation to reveal the true state of the economy. “Meanwhile, dividend income players are taking position ahead of more economic data, even amidst the expected sustained volatility and repositioning. However, we would like to reiterate that investors should not panic but go for equities with intrinsic value, especially during this season when dividend payment is approaching.” On the price movement chart, Betaglas emerged the day’s highest price gainer with N3.75 kobo to close at N79.25 per share while Julius Berger followed with N1.15 kobo to close at N28.05 per share.
