  The need for Nigeria to be restructured to true federalism as urgent as possible if the country does not want to risk imminent collapse soon, was the subject of discussion at the 10-year anniversary symposium lecture titled: ‘Leadership and the Future of Nigeria’ organised in memory of the late Chairman, National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) and leader of the Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Senator Abraham Adesanya in Lagos yesterday.   
  
While former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and his erstwhile vice, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar showered encomiums on the virtues and selfless services, dedication and patriotic commitment of Senator Adesanya to the Nigerian project during his lifetime, the former Secretary General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku in his keynote address and Second Republic Senator, Prof. Seth Akintoye said it was imperative of the Federal Government and the lawmakers to heed the growing warning signs of potential national disaster by agreeing to adopt a restructured true federalism, which they agreed would provide the best basis for the realization of the Nigerian dream.
 
According to Anyaoku, “Senator Abraham Adesanya was a symbol of authentic combination of loyalty to one’s ethnic group and loyalty to one’s country. He was at the same time an outstanding leader of Afenifere that sought to promote and protect the interest of the Yoruba and a nationalist leader of NADECO that sought to promote and protect democracy in his country, Nigeria. Inspired by the sage Chief Obafemi Awolowo, he led a life of idealism in which service to the Yoruba and to Nigeria was an uncompromising credo.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
