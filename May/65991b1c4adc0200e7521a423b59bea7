  The presence of the armed policemen may not be unconnected with last Friday’s Supreme Court ruling in the legal tussle between Chris Giwa and the Amaju Pinnick-led NFF. It was understood that the NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, envisaging disturbance, requested for police protection of the federation’s staff and property. And shortly before he (Dr. Sanusi) drove out yesterday evening to attend a meeting outside the NFF secretariat, he was seen whispering to an inspector, one of the top officials that led the policemen to the NFF, that their allowance would be paid to them today. The Guardian gathered that there were intelligent reports that there could be trouble should the Giwa camp try to forcefully gain entrance to the secretariat. Meanwhile, the NFF First Vice President/Chairman, Legal Committee, Seyi Akinwunmi has assured Nigerians that the ongoing court case will not compel FIFA to ban Nigeria from participating at the 2018 World Cup.
