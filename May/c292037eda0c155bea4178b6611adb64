When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer of the state police command, SP Magaji Majiya, confirmed the development, saying that the deployment was to forestall a breach of peace. “We need peace in the entire state so we will not allow anybody to tamper with prevailing peace and harmony being enjoyed in the state,” Majiya said.
