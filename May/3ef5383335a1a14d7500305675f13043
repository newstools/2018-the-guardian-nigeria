Crown Jewels, a London-based prophylactic manufacturer, has launched a limited edition unofficial Royal Wedding condoms to celebrate Britain’s most anticipated wedding between Prince Harry and US actress Meghan Markle. The rubber “promise discerning love-makers a royal union of pleasure and style” and is “tailored to a regal fit and drizzled with lube”. <img class="size-full wp-image-632513 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="814" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms-940x598.jpg 940w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms-487x310.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms-974x619.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms-320x204.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms-640x407.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/condoms-600x382.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Photo credit: AFP PHOTO / Daniel SORABJI The four-pack comes in a blue fancy box which pops up a picture of the Prince and Meghan. It is the only rubber to exclusively play the British and US anthem. A cursive writing also displays the legend ‘Your prince will come’. Those who desire to purchase it need not spend much, the royal-themed rubber costs $14 dollars (N5,047). Hopefully, “your own prince will come”.
