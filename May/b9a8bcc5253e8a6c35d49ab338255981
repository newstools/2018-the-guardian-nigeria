 Dino Melaye  Led by counsel to the prosecution Alex Iziyon, the prosecution said, “Melaye is a kind of person that had jumped out of a moving bus when they were taking to Lokoja.”However, in a response to the affidavit, the defendant’s counsel Mike Ozekhome countered saying that the Police had told Melaye he was being taken to an FCT high court to be arraigned only for them to suddenly veer off going to Lokoja. According to him, while they were in the vehicle going to Lokoja at the Area1 intersection round about, the police tear gassed Melaye two times when he protested as to why they were now taking him to Lokoja instead of Abuja FCT. “After the car came to a stand still, he forced open the bus door and jumped down because he was now gasping for breadth so that he would not suffocate and the video went viral where Melaye shouted they want to kill him by taking him to Lokoja.’’ He said because of that his sympathisers and boys who gathered including his lawyers quickly took him to Zankli Hospital. “It was from the Zankli hospital that the police again came and bundled him to the National Hospital Abuja where they chained him like a common criminal to a bed.”He argued that someone who wanted to escape from justice would not be in the hospital. “So we have to counter this false allegation.” He also pointed out that the National Hospital where the chief judge of Kogi State ordered that Melaye be taken to, diagnosed that Dino is an asthmatic patient and has serious spinal cord injury. He needs to come back to the hospital on May 9 for further examination.The presiding Judge, Justice Nasiru Ajana adjourned the hearing on the bail application to Thursday, May 10, 2018.
