 Father O’Connel Science College, Minna (representing Niger) versus Christ Comprehensive College (representing Kaduna) at the Boys final of the 20th Milo Secondary School Basketball Championship Emirates Conference at the Kwara State Township Stadium, Ilorin… last week.  While Murtala Muhammed College, Yola defeated St. Augustine’s Seminary Ezzamgbo, Ebonyi State 46 to 29 in one of the semifinals yesterday, Father O’Connel Science College Minna booked their ticket by beating International School (Unilag), Lagos State, 55 to 42. Earlier yesterday, Wesley Girls Secondary School Sabo, Yaba, Lagos State defeated Government Secondary School, Numan, Adamawa State 46 to 21 in the girl’s Classification match. Speaking to The Guardian, coach of Gen. Murtala Muhammed College Yola, Dickson Tinism said he was excited by his team’s victory even although their preparation for the competition was just two days of camping. “The root of the victory is teamwork and hard training. Sports is about ability to achieve your goals and what the technical officials has to offer. With this, I am sure we will be able to defeat Niger.” The coordinator of school sports, Father O’Connel Science Collage, Minna, Niger State, Alhaji Kudu Umaru, said: “Education and sports go hand in hand. Since it will be the first time that both teams are playing, it will be a bit challenging. What makes my team different from others is brain work.” Umaru disclosed that they won last year’s championship and they didn’t miss any competition because, according to him, “We have the support from our school authority.” He appealed to government to encourage the players to complement what Milo is doing for basketball in the country.
