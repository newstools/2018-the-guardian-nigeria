Muhammadu Buhari. PHOTO: Qed.ng President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, in Daura, Katsina State, said his motivation for seeking public office is to serve the people and see their lives improved. The President, who spoke at the All Progressives Party’s (APC) ward congress held at Bayagida Model Primary School, said these objectives informed his choice to join partisan politics and made him to contest elections in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015. A statement signed by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, quoted the President as saying: “I am not in politics for fun, frivolity or to amass wealth. I have always been driven by a deep sense of commitment to make a difference to the lives of our people. “After my retirement from the army, or forceful retirement, I sat back and watched as events unfolded on the political turf and realised the country needed an intervention for fairness, justice and inclusion of Nigerians in the issues that affect their lives.” The President called for patience, maturity and orderliness as the 2019 election calendar begins to unfold, urging political parties, candidates and the electorate to put the country first and always remember that victory belongs to God. In his remarks, the Katsina State governor, Alhaji Aminu Masari, said the process of electing the leaders of the party at the ward level was hitch-free, orderly and based on the constitution of the APC. “What we have here are our leaders that were chosen based on consensus, and we are happy that it reflects the will of the people and the APC constitution. We followed the process to also ensure that there is affirmation,” he said. The chairman of the organising committee for the congress, who is also the Commissioner of Justice and Attorney General, Ahmad Usman El-Marzuq, urged the party leaders to remain loyal and live up to expectations.
