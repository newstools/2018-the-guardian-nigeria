To accelerate progress towards water access and security for citizens in developing countries, Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBFA) has disclosed plans to embark on a major global water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) campaign. The launch followed the United Nations (UN) Secretary General’s call to action on WASH in healthcare facilities in March 2018, which coincides with the World Health Organisations (WHO) ‘Save Lives’, clean your hands campaign day. Speaking yesterday, in Abuja at the launch, wife of the Senate President, Toyin Saraki, expressed delight in the partnership of WBFA and the Global Water 2020, as well as other partners to improve WASH facilities at healthcare centres and schools around the world. According to Saraki, in the analysis of 129,000 healthcare facilities in developing world, researchers found that more than 65 per cent lack both running water and soap for hand washing. She said: “Here in Nigeria, the WHO found that 29 per cent of healthcare facilities do not have access to safe water and toilets, while a WaterAid survey revealed that half of primary health facilities do not have hand washing facilities in delivery rooms. “Pregnant women and newborns are thereby placed in huge danger and at risk of sepsis, which is a leading cause of death in hospitals. Without adequate WASH facilities, midwives all over the world are unable to safely carry out their crucial work and lead the way with quality care.” Saraki, who is also the Founder of WBFA, said her foundation is working with midwives to ensure that mothers and babies are safe. She explained that the campaign would champion the improvement of WASH facilities in schools, adding that the physical environment and cleanliness of schools significantly affects the health and wellbeing of children.
