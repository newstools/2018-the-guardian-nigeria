 The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has described as ‘mere fabrication’ a report that athletes who participated at the just concluded All Comers event in Port Harcourt were accommodated in a mosquito-infested hotel.  PHOTO: FEMI ADEBESIN-KUTI.  There is a policy that if you are good and you win laurels for the state you should be employed. My coach is on level 14 and there is this policy if you win something they move you to the next level but for sometime nothing has happened. “They won the last sports festival in Lagos, nothing, last year Cecilia Otu was national champion, nothing, this year the same thing but no promotion for the athletes and coaches. We are trying to streamline it and push to the governor for approval. With that nobody will poach anybody.
 
“This poaching was done before we came because these athletes were not documented. The consultant had said the 14 athletes he wanted to give them a better life and put them in Universities in US but that was done yet no link to the state that created the athletes. There is no where you discover an athlete for a University that you do not get a percentage as an agent. One of them Edidiong Ofonime qualified for semifinal for Bahrain at the Olympics. She was here running and last December she was here on holiday. We came but did not see any athlete but we heard there was a training programme.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
