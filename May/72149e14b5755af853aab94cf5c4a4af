 President Muhammadu Buhari  The President made the call when he received Letter of Credence from Mr Robert Jan Petri, the Ambassador of Netherlands to Nigeria. President Buhari said Nigeria would continue to vigorously pursue the replenishment of the Lake Chad Basin, which had dried up to 10 percent of its original size. ”With the population growth in Nigeria and the drying up of the Lake Chad, we have to move faster and adapt to the impacts of climate change through technological solutions, ” he said. The President told the Dutch Ambassador that following Nigeria’s active participation in UN-organized Climate Change conferences in 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Nigerian government successfully hosted a high-level international conference on Lake Chad in February 2018. He noted that the high-level conference provided an opportunity to push further options to restore the Lake Chad, including the inter-basin water transfer project from Ubangi River in Central Africa to the Lake. On agriculture, the President welcomed the interest by some Nigerian doctoral students studying in the Netherlands on developing the sector through research and innovation, particularly the livestock sector. In separate remarks, while receiving the Letter of Credence from the High Commissioner of the Republic of Botswana, Mr Pule Mphothwe, Buhari commended the Southern African country for its consistent support to Nigeria in the international fora.
