  Makarfi cautioned the former President on the heels of his antagonism against the PDP and other opposition parties in the country, saying Obasanjo’s attitudes and actions may only pave way for the APC to cling onto power in 2019. According to him, unless Obasanjo joined political forces with other opposition elements in Nigeria to form a formidable platform against Buhari in 2019, “what we fear most about the APC perpetuating itself in power will only be facilitated by his (Obasanjo) actions. Makarfi, who was a former governor of Kaduna State, was reacting in an interview in Kaduna, to the criticisms of Obasanjo against the PDP and some other opposition elements in the country, stressing “the present actions of our former President will only facilitate the failed APC government to remain in office in 2019 if we are not careful. “We still respect him as former president and elder statesman in Nigeria. Somebody, in spite of his shortcomings, I believe he still earns respect. But again, divided opposition is not a good way to kick APC out of power in 2019. It is actually the surest way of making APC to remain in power. “So, I want everybody to think twice and assess individuals actions towards opposition parties. If APC hadn’t come together as a coalition of interests in 2015 APC, it won’t have pushed PDP out of power.  And if we don’t do the same, what ha may be fearing, with others like him they will just facilitate it.
