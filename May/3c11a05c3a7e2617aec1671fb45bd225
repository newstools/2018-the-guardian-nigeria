In the world today, there are quite a number of people who choose to remain in unhealthy and abusive relationships. This can be due to a number of factors but most time, the reasons can all be linked to fear. Whether it’s the fear of being alone, the fear of rejection or the fear of finding someone else; all these fears contribute to enduring abuse in relationships. Whatever the reasons may be, here are some helpful tips that can help you break free. The first step is to know your fears. Being aware of the things that you are afraid of sets you on the path to freedom. Sometimes, abuse in a relationship stems from the inability to set personal boundaries. If this is the case and your partner takes this weakness for granted, a love that was once beautiful can turn ugly in a short space of time. Whatever the feat might be—fear of not being good enough, fear of rejection, fear of being alone—identify them. After identifying your fears, it’s important to know that the most important person in the relationship is you. Loving yourself leads to eliminating these fears because the more you love yourself the more value you place on your well-being and emotional health. This cannot be achieved in a day but you need to make an effort to constantly remind yourself that your happiness comes before anything else. If your partner has no regard for you or your worth, then they do not deserve you.
