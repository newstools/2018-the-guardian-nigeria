Unless Huddersfield can beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, Liverpool will go into Sunday’s home game against Brighton knowing they must at least match Chelsea’s result against Newcastle, managed by former Reds boss Rafael Benitez. Should they fail, they would have to beat Real Madrid in this month’s Champions League final in Kiev to qualify for Europe’s premier club competition. “It’s my life, it’s our life, that we always make it a little bit more exciting,” Klopp told liverpoolfc.com. “We had these situations a few times and it will be, for sure, exciting because Brighton is in a good moment, they played fantastic against (Manchester) United. “But it’s all OK, as long as we have it in our own hands, life is good. We still have to take it then but we will try everything.” After five matches, including an emotionally draining two-legged Champions League semi-final, in 16 days Klopp has a full week to prepare for the crucial fixture. “I’m really happy that this very intense period is over now because we have one week to prepare for Brighton — that feels like a year and we will use that,” he added. Liverpool have suffered a fresh injury blow after England defender Joe Gomez was ruled out of the Champions League final following surgery on an ankle injury, putting his World Cup participation in doubt. Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has already been ruled out of the showpiece in Russia with a knee injury. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
