Eyes Call Up To Super Eagles Nigeria rising star, Tobi Adewale, has again made the USL Team of the Week, after putting up another five-star performance for Pittsburgh Riverhounds who recorded a lone goal victory against Atlanta United in the six-week-old league. One remarkable aspect of the victory was that Riverhounds made their fifth shutout in six games.The Pittsburgh defense was suffocating, allowing zero shots on goal despite the visitors holding a 60-40 edge in possession. Adewole, who is eying a call up to the Nigerian U-23 national team, led the way with a team-high eight clearances in addition to three tackles, two interceptions and an 8-for-13 success rate on aerial duels. The Nigerian young defender has anchored the Hounds central defense to tie for the league lead in shutouts with five. He leads the club with 41 clearances and 14 interceptions, while also being one of only three Hounds players to have played in every minute so far this season (540 minutes total). The accolade marks the fourth straight week a Hound has been named to USL Team of the Week, as Adewole follows up Thomas Vancaeyezeele (Week 6), his own nomination in Week 5 and Neco Brett (Week 4 – Player of the Week). Fresh off an unbeaten April, and in the midst of a six-game unbeaten streak, Riverhounds SC hits the road for its second meeting against Toronto FC II this season today, May 5. The match will kick off at 6 p.m. and take place at Marina Auto Stadium in Rochester, New York. Speaking with The Guardian ahead of the clash against Toronto FC II, Adewole said: “My dream is to play for Nigerian U-23 team and the Super Eagles. It will be a dream come true for me.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
