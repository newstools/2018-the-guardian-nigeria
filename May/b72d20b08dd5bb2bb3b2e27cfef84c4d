The Frenchman won the Uefa Champions League three times consecutively with the Spanish team. His last Champions League triumph came last week against Liverpool. Zidane, 46, joined Real Madrid in 2016 when he replaced Rafael Benitez before leading the team to their 11th Europeam trophy. He won the LaLiga and the Champions League in his second season when Real Madrid defeated Juventus. Zidane said in a news press conference that it was the right time to leave Real Madrid before he thanked Florentino Perez and the club. “This is the right moment for everyone. It might seem strange, but it had to be done for the good of everyone, the players, the club, and myself. This team must keep winning, and it needs a change after 3 years, another voice, another method of working,” Zidane said. “I love this club and the president who gave me the chance to play for this club and manage the club of my dreams, but everything changes and that is why I have taken the decision to leave.” Zidane was in charge of 149 Real Madrid games, he won 104 games and had 29 draws.
