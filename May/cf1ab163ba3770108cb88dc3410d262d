“So what does love mean to you? Tell me…” These are the first words you hear when you listen to Waje’s new single, Each Other. She declares her definition of love with instances of holding your hand regardless of the treatment she gets from you or the way you are feeling. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-647009 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Each-Other-artwork.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" /> Each Other, a song produced by SizzlePRO, promotes positivity, hope, peace togetherness and strength to wish all Nigerians a happy Democracy Day. It was released ahead of her forthcoming EP set to be released later in the year. It may seem like there is nothing to celebrate, but we at least have Each Other. Listen to the new track below.
