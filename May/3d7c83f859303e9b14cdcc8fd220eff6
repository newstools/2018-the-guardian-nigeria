Addressing journalists in Enugu, leader of the group, Benjamin Onwuka, said there was no going back on the declaration of Biafra and dared the law enforcement agencies to arrest him. He said: “By 7.00 am on Wednesday, May 30, I will be at the Enugu Government House on Nza Street to declare Biafra’s Independence. I have informed the Nigerian army and on that day, they will see that there is greater power. “We will take over the government house to announce Biafra. It was done in Kosovo backed by the United States of America and our own should not be an exception. Let them bring out their gun and any other weapon, but nothing shall stop us.” Onwuka also asked indigenes of defunct Biafra to ignore the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) on May 30 and throng the Enugu Government House for the event.
