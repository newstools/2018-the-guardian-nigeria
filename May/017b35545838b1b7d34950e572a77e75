Thirty-year-old woman, Ayo Sheriff, who was remanded in Kirikiri prison for using hot pressing iron to torture her daughter has been granted bail in the sum of N200,000. In a ruling on Monday, the Magistrate, Mrs. O. Sule-Amzat, granted the bail to Sheriff with two sureties in like sum. Sule-Hamzat said the sureties must be gainfully employed and one of them must be a relative. Also, an order that a psychiatric test be conducted on the defendant was also issued and that the result must be presented before the court on the next adjourned date of June 21. It would be recalled that Sheriff was docked before an Ikeja Magistrates Court for allegedly burning her 16-year-old daughter, Aishat Sheriff with electric iron. The victim had suffered from burns inflicted on her by her mother who reportedly used the equipment to burn her upper and lower right limbs. The suspect is now facing charges of alleged abuse of the secondary school student who is also a part time student nurse in auxiliary capacity. Trouble started when the victim could not account for the sum of N500 balance of the money given by her boss. On the day she was supposed to return the balance to her boss, the victim could not produce the money. She told her boss that the money was with her mother. The boss called her mother on the phone who denied knowledge of the money. While the victim was heading home, her mother had plugged a pressing iron, beat the victim and burnt her with electric iron for lying, causing her injury on the upper and lower right limps. Police prosecutor, Emuheri Benson, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on April 24, 2018 in the Orile Iganmu area of Lagos State. He said the offence contravened and punishable under 173 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the two counts charge of child abuse preferred against her.
