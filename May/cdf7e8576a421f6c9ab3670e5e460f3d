AFP PHOTO / STEFAN HEUNIS Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State has called on the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Presidential Committee on Northeast Initiative (PCNI) to intervene in the completion of roads and housing projects in the state. One of such is the rebuilding of the 190-kilometre Maiduguri-Bama-Banki and Bama-Gwoza roads, re-opened last month by military. Displaced persons in Gwoza also require 1,000 housing units to replace shelters destroyed by insurgents in 2014. Shettima made the call at the weekend when the National Refugees Commission was distributing aid at Gwoza. The items were donated by PCNI to the state government. “We have to overcome the main challenge of rebuilding these Cameroonian border roads that link Gwoza and Pulka,” he said. He said the rehabilitation of the roads would fast track the return of displaced persons in Maiduguri camps and host communities. The governor further disclosed that Boko Haram destroyed over 56,600 houses, but the Ministry of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (MRRR) has rebuilt 11,630 in Bama and 1,800 shops and market stalls.
