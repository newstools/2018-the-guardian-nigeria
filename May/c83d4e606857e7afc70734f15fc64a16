 Chief Executive Officer of MProbity, Martins Egbe  “GEPPP, which is an acronym for Global Exceeding Performance Potential Probation, is a workplace performance and communication management technology that connects every hierarchy of workforce and intelligently reveals possibilities. “Our technology is better than others out there because it is very simplified and you do not have to spend extra money hiring programmers. We help companies manage their valuable time and focus on their businesses while we do the dirty work for them,” he stated. GEPPP is a reinvention of the African workplace, created to plug organisations into the expanding era of super-efficiencies that deliver super-results through super-engagement of people for super-pursuits of corporate goals. Egbe also stated that GEPPP is for all types of organizations in Nigeria, Africa, and the rest of the world. These include; businesses, NGOs, clubs, government agencies and nstitutionsc. These are just some of the benefits of using the GEPP software.“So far, over 20 companies are already on it. We should have launched with the old model a long time ago but I have to be sure whatever I am putting out there is better than whatever Mark Zuckerburg or other popular programmers has done, because they are not better me.”GEPPP is positioning to be the number one workplace performance and communication management software in Africa.
