Mr. Obafela Bank-Olemoh, Special Adviser to the Governor on Education, in a statement said the present administration was committed to the vision of the CodeLagos programme geared towards making Lagos State the technology frontier in Africa by empowering people with skills needed to create and take advantage of the opportunities a tech-driven economy proffers. He said, â€œWe are excited to announce that the programme is expanding. We have scaled up the numbers of our coding centres, from 193 schools last year to 275 this term; and we have plans to keep scaling up. Out of the 275 schools, 130 of those are Government schools while 145 are private schools. We have already trained over 250 facilitators to deliver the Coding Framework to students in these schools.
