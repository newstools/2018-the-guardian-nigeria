“Love feels not with the eyes, but with the mind.” <img class="size-medium wp-image-625517 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_7761-1-897x598.jpg" alt="" width="897" height="598" /> This Shakespearean quote tattooed on the arm of famous Brtish fashion designer Alexander McQueen, is one of the many inspirations for an artwork by Rom Isichei, a lover of Modernist architecture and one of Nigeria’s more famous artists. On Saturday, the 28th of April, Open House Lagos gave individuals a chance to explore the spectacular home and studio of Isichei, which was designed by architect Sola Adesina. <img class="size-medium wp-image-625513 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_7756-399x598.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="598" /> Located in Ilupeju, Lagos, the building houses a home in front and a two-level studio which can be approached from a side street. The large living area doubles as a gallery with large canvasses hanging on the walls. The studio also accommodates finished and unfinished works by the artist himself.
