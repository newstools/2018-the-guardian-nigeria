The past few weeks have seen the world’s attention shift from one alluring event to another. Yet, we haven’t had enough. We are excited that the most fashionable film festival of the year is finally here, and is currently being held from 8 to 19 May 2018 in the south of France against the astonishing Mediterranean vistas. Higher hemlines have been the unofficial theme of the film festival with celebrities like Chloe Sevigny, penelope cruz rocking ruffled dresses. Ball dresses were also stunning on the red carpet with celebrities like Fan Bing Bing and Jessica Chastain rocking them. So far, we have seen a number of show-stopping red carpet looks, which made the cut for us.
