The suspect who had worked with frontline hospitals in Lagos, like Eko Hospital and Tolu Medical Centre usually hacked into customers’ accounts with banks and financial institutions’ as well as monitors private email messages of prominent Nigerians. He accessed customers’ bank accounts and spent their monies to enjoy his credit cards. He confessed that through the hacking expertise he acquired in Canada, he delved into fraudulent activities. Williams explained he could buy various goods worth  40 million naira with credit cards and make false payments in tranches to unsuspecting victims. Williams met his waterloo on 23rd March 2018 when a complaint was lodged to the police by a car shop owner, one Abidogun Adewale, that a syndicate bought exotic cars of N28million, paid into his bank account but on visiting his banker, he discovered he had actually received a false bank alert indicating payment for a Porsche car. While parading Williams today at the Police Command Headquarters, the Lagos State Police boss, Mr. Imohimi Edgal told newsmen that the suspect during his dialogue with him admitted commission of the crime. According to the police boss, “the suspect is a member of a syndicate that goes to car shops, buys a car, configures a computer program that would send a fake payment alert to the seller and by so doing, obtains a car.” Edgal said Abidogun Adewale whose car shop played host to Williams’ syndicate bought a Porsche car at a whopping price of twenty-eight million Naira (N28,000,000:OO). Adding that the suspect thereafter requested for the seller’s bank account number and made it look like he had paid him via the fake alert to his phone using HTTP tunnel.com. Thereafter, the suspect drives the car away, unknown to the seller that he had been scammed. A police manhunt was launched on the fleeing suspect by the Command, dispatching detectives of the FSARS led bu CSP Sanusi Mohammed and all necessary intelligence asset after the suspect, this led to the arrest of the suspect in Lekki, Lagos. “Upon his arrest, he led detectives to Asaba, Delta State, where the stolen Porsche car was recovered. “He also led detectives to Owerri, Imo State where two Camry Saloon Cars he stole in a similar fashion were recovered.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
