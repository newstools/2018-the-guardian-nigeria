Canada’s next federal election is scheduled for 2019. “With the passage of this bill,” acting Democratic Institutions Minister Scott Brison told a news conference, “foreign entities will no longer be able to spend money to influence federal elections.” Currently, foreign entities can spend up to Can$500 ($390 US) on election advertising. Under the proposed measure, Canadian advertisers would not be allowed to knowingly accept monies from foreigners to influence elections. Political parties would also have to disclose what voter information they collect and how they use it, in an effort to make data use more transparent. And, the bill would repeal a statute passed by the previous Tory administration that prohibits Canadians living abroad for more than five years from voting, affecting more than one million Canadians abroad.
