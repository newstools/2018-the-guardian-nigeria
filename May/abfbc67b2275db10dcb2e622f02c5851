We are all as surprised as John Legend’s wife, Chrissy Teigen, is. It turns out that Legend has been nominated, in the 2018 Tony Awards, for Best Original Score alongside rapper, T.I for Spongebob Squarepants: The Musical. While T.I wrote a song titled, When The Going Gets Tough (for Plankton and Karen); Legend was behind (I Guess I) Miss You (for Spongebob and Patrick) Teigen expressed shock when she heard of the nomination. John got nominated for a Tony this morning for a song he apparently wrote for spongebob squarepants. Why does he not tell me when he writes spongebob songs?? What else is he lying about?? Are there other songs out there?? — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 1, 2018  In gen Spongebob Squarepants: The Musical got 12 nominations
