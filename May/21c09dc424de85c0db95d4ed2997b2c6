They expressed their continued support for his position on ranching and noted that he had been vindicated about the law at various levels. The stakeholders noted that although the security and economic challenges in the state were not his creation, Ortom was tackling them with commitment, transparency and fairness. They noted that APC’s National Executive Committee (NWC) directive for elective congresses and that of the North Central Zonal leadership that the former party executives be retained at all levels.
