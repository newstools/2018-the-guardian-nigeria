 INDIAN WELLS, CA – MARCH 08: Serena Williams reacts against Zarina Diyas, of Kazakhstan, during Day 4 of the BNP Paribas Open on March 8, 2018 in Indian Wells, California.

Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova and defending champion and US Open finalist Madison Keys have also committed to play in the event that is part of the build up to the US Open. On Wednesday, the 36-year-old Williams pulled out of next week’s Italian Open in Rome, a tournament she has won four times. That followed her withdrawal from Madrid and raised doubts as to whether she’ll be ready for the French Open in Paris May 27-June 10. The American tennis star made her return to the court in February, six months after giving birth to her daughter Olympia, but has admitted she is struggling to get fully fit.
