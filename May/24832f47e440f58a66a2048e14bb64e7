Barely two weeks after some armed thugs invaded the Senate Chamber, overpowered security men and took away the mace, the atmosphere within the National Assembly became charged Wednesday as some strange armed and masked men believed to be men of the Department of State Service (DSS) stormed the Assembly premises. The men armed with special guns called Tavor were 10 in number and took positions around the building that houses the two chambers of the National Assembly. When confronted for an explanation on what must have informed the sudden change in security strategy, a top security officer in the National Assembly who prefer not to be identified, stated that there were some security developments that dictated the new trend. According to him, “There are issues within security circles which you cannot understand. And because of the sensitivity of such issues, they cannot be divulged to the general public for now.” Some of the masked men were seen in front of the entrance to the Senate chamber, others at the route leading to the office of the Senate President while more were at the entrance to the white house. However, at the time of sending this report, the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, who was invited by the Senate to appear today over rising insecurity in the country, was yet to arrive.
