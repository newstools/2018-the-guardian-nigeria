  Secondus, through his lawyer, Emeka Etiaba (SAN), in a letter Ref No: EESE&C/02/03/05/1 and dated May 3, 2018 titled “Re: Mention of Prince Uche Secondus on the list of looters of Nigeria economy” and copied to the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation and some foreign missions in Nigeria, insisted that he never collected or sent anybody to collect on his behalf money at any time from the former NSA. Secondus said he believes that the continued listing of his name might be a deliberate ploy by the commission to implicate him, scandalise his name in a desperate attempt by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to suppress him and dent the credibility of his party that is being rebranded. The letter also reminded the EFCC that the issue concerning Secondus is already in court and wondered why the commission should not approach the court with its evidence if any, instead of continuously indulging in media trial. According to the letter: “The attention of EFCC was drawn to the suit before the Chief Judge of Rivers State in Port Harcourt where an interlocutory order was granted against the defendants and same restrained them from further publishing the name of Secondus.’’ Read More: Court restrains Federal Government from publishing Secondus’ name on looters list The letter also drew the attention of the commission to the injunction order published in the dailies as ordered by the court, a copy of which was attached to the letter to the commission. “The said publication by the minister has become a subject matter of Suit No: PHC/1013/2018 in Prince Uche Secondus Vs.
