Osu added that it would also be used to deliberate how media Practitioners could use their tools of trade to reach and promote peace in their various societies. He said that the World Communications Day was established by Pope Paul VI in 1967 as an annual celebration that encourages media Practitioners to reflect on the opportunities and challenges that the modern means of social communication afford the church to preach the gospel. Every year on the Sunday before Pentecost the Church celebrates the achievements of the communications media and focuses of how it can best use them to promote gospel values. The theme for this year’s event is: “The truth will set you free” (Jn 8:32), Fake news and journalism for peace”. “World Communications Day is an annual event set aside by the Pope Francis1 to appreciate the importance of communication and media practitioners in  the evangelical effort of the Church. “As is customary, there will  be a Mass at the Holy Cross Cathedral by 10.am with Most Rev. Alfred Adewale Martins, as the Chief Celebrant. “During  the Mass, the Papal message will be read while the tools of trade for the Catholic Media Practitioners wil also be blessed,” he said.
