The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama Still nursing the pains of defeat he suffered in the Enugu State congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffery Onyeama, yesterday accused the national leadership of the party of complicity in an alleged plot to derail democracy in the party and foist unpopular candidates to it. He also denied procuring the services of thugs or causing violence at the Nnamdi Azikiwe venue that allegedly disrupted the smooth conduct of the state congress on Saturday. The Minister told reporters in Enugu, that the behaviour of the congress committee members right from the ward elections was an indication that the party’s national headquarters was compromised, insisting that justice and fairness should be applied to integrate the party members in the process. Onyeama, who stated that the process was flawed from the beginning, wondered how the party’s congress committee could deliver materials meant for the exercise to the chairman of the party in the state, even when it was obvious that he was an interested party and in the process shutting members from participation.
