 Osun state  The party said it remains the most credible platform that can serve the interest of Nigerians following the alleged failing of the current Federal Government to meet the yearnings of Nigerians. The National Vice Chairman of the party, Mr. Supo Shonibare, said this in Osogbo, Osun State, during the inauguration of a 30-man steering committee to run the affairs of the party in Osun pending the conduct of state congresses. He said: “We have been meeting for the past six months under the auspices, Southern and Middle Belt Forum. We have agreed that the way we run regional government in the 50s is the way to go. “This steering committee would be all inclusive one that will carry along members of the SDP. We have inaugurated the committee in Ekiti and Lagos states. We want to have strong party structures from all the wards, local councils and states throughout Nigeria. 
 
He, therefore, called for the restructuring of the nation, saying the only party that supports restructuring agenda is SDP. That is the reason why we opted out of PDP. We are ready to accommodate members of other political parties, including the PDP and Accord Party (AP). Another chieftain of the party and former Ambassador of Nigeria to Philipines, Dr. Yemi Farounbi, who expressed optimism that the party would triumph in the Ekiti and Osun states 2018 governorship elections, said: “Whether they are incumbent or outgoing, they are going back to their house. If we can register five million members, we would win the coming poll, go and work assiduously. “We are all one family and we should work together. SDP is about creating a new socio-political order of the country. The economic structure of this nation is broken because the foundation is weak. When restructuring is carried out, this would pave way to address all the challenges confronting Nigeria.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
