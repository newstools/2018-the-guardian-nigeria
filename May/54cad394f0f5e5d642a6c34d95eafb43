  Dosunmu made the call while addressing residents of Egbeda and Ajorosun areas during a sensitisation on voter education, at Monatan, Ibadan. The theme of the programme is “Strengthening Political Participation for Grassroots Development”. The director appealed to the electorate to see participation in elections as their civic responsibility. ”Our people should take both council polls and general elections as priorities through active participation. ”Voting apathy is inimical to democratic governance; so, eligible voters should endeavour to come out and vote during elections.

Some of the participants called on INEC to address the hiccups that were slowing down the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR). Mr Johnson Abidakun, Esther Asabi and Odedoyin Ogunwale, urged the commission to increase the number of CVR machines to five in each registration centre to make more people to register with ease. Mr Waheed Oyewole, Chairman of Inter-party Advisory Commission (IPAC) in the state, urged leaders of political parties to do more in sensitising their members on the need to collect their PCVs. No fewer than 300 residents, including community leaders, in Egbeda Local Government and Ajorosun Local Community Development Authority were present at the session.
