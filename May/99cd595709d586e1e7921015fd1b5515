 British High Commissioner in Nigeria, Mr Paul Arkwright  According to a statement by the Commission’s Press and Public Affairs Officer, Joe Abuku, the commission as part of activities to mark  the 2018 Children’s Day had in company of Super Eagles players visited children at the Modern Secondary School GRA, Port Harcourt. Abuku noted that Super Eagles players William Troost-Ekong and Leon Balogun gave the kids Premier League kit donated by the UK’s Royal Airforce Football Association’s ‘Taking football to Africa and Beyond’ appeal. The players answered the children’s questions and heard their hopes and aspirations for the future. Defender Troost-Ekong told the children that he had always loved football and with hard work, dedication and support from his parents he was delighted to have made it to the top. He added that Balogun, who recently joined Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion, advised the children on the importance of education – that they should work hard at school and not give up on their dreams. Abuku observed that the students were delighted to test out their own football skills, while the players were highly impressed with an outstanding performance of the Nigerian National Anthem.
