President Muhammadu Buhari President Mohammadu Buhari Thursday refuted allegations that he interfered in the affairs of the All Progressives Congress (APC) or matters before the law courts. President Buhari said it is not in his nature to go against the provisions of the country’s constitution let alone his party’s constitutional provisions. The President’s denial came amidst mounting allegations that some names of members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Convention Planning Sub-Committees were smuggled in by the Presidency. Recall that, members of the aggrieved New Peoples’ Democratic Party (nPDP) in the APC on Wednesday accused the Presidency of replacing about 50 names from the original list during the inauguration. The protesting APC members said their names were initially on the published convention committee list. But reacting in a statement signed by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the Presidency stated that nothing in the allegation can be further from the truth in every material particular. It described as disingenuous to attribute every perceived infraction in activities of party or government appointees to the President’s desk. “For the umpteenth time, we wish to­ reiterate President Muhammadu Buhari’s ­position that he will not interfere in p­arty affairs or matters before the law c­ourts. “It ought to have been obvious by now to ­discerning Nigerians that it is not in t­he nature of this President to go agains­t the provisions of the country’s consti­tution let alone his party’s constitutio­nal provisions,” the Presidency noted.
