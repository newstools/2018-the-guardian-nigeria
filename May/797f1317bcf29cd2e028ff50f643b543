Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye Except Nigeria urgently finds lasting solution to incessant killings in the country, the 2019 general elections may not hold. General Overseer (G.O.) of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye, made this assertion, yesterday, at the May edition of the monthly Holy Ghost service, held at the Redemption Camp. Clad in a white short sleeve shirt and a bow tie, he regretted the killings of Christians and Muslims, especially at worship centres. He said a bishop asked him if God had spoken to him about who would win the 2019 election. “I responded, saying that is if the election even holds. These killings, if not urgently addressed, could prevent elections from holding in 2019. People would be afraid to do anything election.” He said: “A nation can survive a civil war, but no nation can withstand a religious war. That Nigeria may live, these killings must stop now.” Adeboye, who led prayers for the country, urged people not to lose focus and hope, but continue to pray for the stability of the nation. The programme was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and wife, Dolapo; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel; and Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, among others. One of the Regional Pastors and a Special Assistant to the G.O. on Evangelism, J.T. Kalejaiye, called on Nigerians to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC). He said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) “would not count the number of vigils attended or fasting done, but the PVCs. Therefore, I urge those who are yet to get their PVCs to do so as fast as possible.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
