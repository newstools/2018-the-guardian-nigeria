 K1-Olamide  The song was originally written and released by the fuji maestro 25years ago off his Orin Abode Mecca medley. K1 De Ultimate released the classic song in reverence to his father. Olamide had in 2013 released a song with the same title, Anifowoshe off his Baddest Guy Ever Liveth album, and sampled the voice of K1.K1 in a chat with online news platform, Pulse, revealed that the YBNL head honcho did not receive blessing before sampling the song. “Though he didn’t directly come to me before he did that song, I’m happy; I’m happy and I exempt him of any punishment or lashing because he did it nicely. We want to see the younger ones take over from us and do very well,” he said. “There are a lot of my songs that have been done in the past, that people never come to me to ask for it. Omo Anifowoshe is me, Anifowoshe is my father’s name. It is only in the West you don’t do things like that,” he added. He continues, “If I had rebuked him, take it personal, or said because he didn’t come to me to seek for direct approval for the redoing of that number, what do I gain from it. So rather than rebuke him I instead embraced him.” The fuji impresario who recently turned 61, also confirmed that he has no plans of calling it quit with music anytime soon, adding that he recently concluded work on his new projects including an extended play (EP) with young hiphop producer, Mystro, who infused the trending trap sound into his fuji music.
