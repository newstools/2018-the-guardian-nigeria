The trio of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino have usurped a score-mark of 28 goals in a Champions League campaign previously held by Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013/2014 season. Salah and Firmino boast of 10 goals each this season, while Mane has 9 to take their goal tally to 29. This means the Liverpool team can outscore any team on their day. Most goals scored by a team this
Liverpool have scored 40 goals in the Champions League this season. That’s 10 more than the 30 scored by Real Madrid. With 12 games played already, it means the Kop scored at the ratio of 3.33 goals per game. Better defence than Real Madrid

Real Madrid’s Kiev bad luck
Real Madrid’s last two games in Kiev both in the Champions League ended 2-2 against Dynamo in 2004 (a game in which current coach Zinédine Zidane played) and 2006. They lost 2-0 on their first visit in the 1998/99 quarter-finals, a young Andriy Shevchenko scoring both goals. Similarly, Liverpool has played in Kiev twice, winning 1 and drawing the other. Danny Murphy and Steven Gerrard struck as Liverpool won 2-1 against Dynamo Kyiv at Dynamo Stadium in the 2001/02 UEFA Champions League group stage. Rafael Benítez’s side then drew 1-1 with Maccabi Haifa at the same venue. The odds favour Liverpool winning in Kiev. But will that be the case?
