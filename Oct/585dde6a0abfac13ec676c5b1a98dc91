The exercise, which took several hours, affected three shops, where products under the trademark Sollatek of Sollatek (UK) Limited were stocked and displayed for sale. The seizure followed the order of court granted to Sollatek UK Limited and Sollatek Electronics Limited. The application was supported by an affidavit sworn to by Mishra Vijaykumar, the chief operations officer of Sollatek Electronics Limited, Lagos. A senior police officer, who led the team, said the exercise was in line with the order of court, which directed the police to provide security for the court sheriffs. Justice Mohammed Aikawa of a Federal High Court, has while ruling on an exparte application argued by Peter Shobiye of Pisteuo Solicitors granted the applicant an order enabling them or their representatives to enter the warehouses and shops belonging to the defendants to inspect and remove any Sollatek inscribed and labeled products infringing the Sollatek trademark for use as evidence at the trial of the action. The court also ordered the police to provide protection during the enforcement of the order in every part of Nigeria, where Sollatek inscribed and labeled products infringing the first applicant’s registered trademark and products are sold. Speaking on the exercise, the Intellectual Property & Trademarks Rights Manager, Sollatek (UK) Limited, Mr. Thierry Polet, said the objective is to provide Nigerians protection from electricity surges or power-related issues and to provide safety to life and property. According to him, Sollatek devices protect appliances and homes from over-voltage, under-voltage, surge protection and spikes in electricity. “The fake products, particularly those persons who have used our Sollatek name as part of their brand name, do not provide the same level of protection. Unfortunately, by the time the customer finds out – it’s too late. We always encourage customers to protect their investments, their homes and their lives with original Sollatek products only.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
