Total explained that such capacity-building is one of the ways to transform the society through human, social and economic development; and as such is determined to contribute to turning the tide on poverty in Nigeria. The Executive General Manager, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Total Upstream companies in Nigeria, Vincent Nnadi, said the current state of Nigeria as home to the highest number of people living below the poverty line has made the obligation even more urgent. Nnadi, represented by the General Manager, Corporate Social Responsibility, Dr. Charles Ngeribara, said Total’s capacity development initiatives are empowering as many people as possible, and actively supporting nation-building efforts in line with the numbers one and eight SDGs, which are; “No Poverty”, and “Decent work and Economic Growth”. Speaking during the closing ceremony of its “Business Sustenance for New Entrepreneurs” programme, he said the two-day training is part of Total CSR initiative, designed to transform selected trained youths from basic skills acquisition to professional entrepreneurs with requisite knowledge-based capacity for sustaining their businesses. He said: “The 25 entrepreneurs who are graduating today had undergone initial skills acquisition training in paint manufacturing, inverter and solar systems production and installation, agriculture, web design and PC hardware installation, catering, hospitality and crafts under the youth empowerment, capacity building and skills acquisition programmes of Total Upstream companies between 2016 and 2018.” He charged the graduating entrepreneurs to seize the opportunity offered by the programme to strengthen their businesses, and expand their roles as active agents of wealth creation to the nation. “We believe that following this integrated training, you will be more self-reliant and better developed in self advocacy. You will be able to communicate your ideas and become better team players. You will also develop the ability to set goals and manage your time, and develop your abilities in problem-solving and critical-thinking, which are all essential elements of successful entrepreneurship,” he added.
