• Abdullahi ruled out of reverse fixture
Super Eagles’ Manager, Gernot Rohr wants to beat Libya again tomorrow and ensure Nigeria enters the last two rounds of the Cameroun 2019 African Nations Cup qualifying series already assured of a spot in the championship. The Super Eagles, who defeated Libya by 4-0 in Uyo on Saturday, will leave for Sfax, Tunisia this morning on a chartered flight for the reverse fixture against Libya.The game will hold at the 18,000 capacity Stade Taïeb Mhiri by 7.00 p.m. Nigerian time. Speaking on his expectations of the reverse fixture, Rohr said there was still room for improvement in his team, especially in the defence, adding that such problems would be addressed before tomorrow’s match.HE said, “The scoreline does not mean that we have reached the level we want. “We had obvious problems defensively, especially in the first half and before we play Libya again in three days, we must improve on our weak areas.“Sometimes you get away with mistakes and another time you can easily be punished, it could make a difference whether you can qualify or not. “Our expansive play – by exploring the wings – in the second half helped us against a good side. Now we must maintain discipline in all areas.”Meanwhile, defender, Shehu Abdullahi has been ruled out of the game due to injury. Abdullahi copped a muscle injury early in the first-leg match against Libya in Uyo, prompting the introduction of Ola Aina. He did not train with the rest of the squad yesterday and is expected to return to his Turkish club, Bursaspor, for treatment.
