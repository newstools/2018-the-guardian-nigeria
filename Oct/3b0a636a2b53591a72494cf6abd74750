Rangers Media Officer, Norbert Okolie disclosed yesterday that the national chairman of the team’s supporters club, Ibuchukwu Nwodo, who is also Special Adviser on Rangers Matters to Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has started  meeting with leaders of the various branches of the fans’ body to get as many people as possible to cheer the club in Asaba. According to Okolie, Nwodo has set up a five-man committee for the success of the trip to Asaba as he hopes to have half of the Stephen Keshi Stadium painted in the red and white with over 10, 000 strong supporters. “I am indeed very glad that we are in the finals once again after a lengthy break and we hope to make it count. No doubt, we expect a tough challenge from Kano Pillars but with the way our team has been playing, I don’t see us letting the cup slip through our fingers. We, members of the supporters club have put a committee in place to help us organize a smooth movement to Asaba and back with the trophy. We are looking to mobilizing ten thousand of our members to storm Asaba to drum our darling Rangers to a resounding victory,” Nwodo said. He added, “With the arrangement on ground, we hope to depart Enugu with at least 50 buses comprising Marcopolo, Coaster and mini buses conveying our supporters to Asaba while our branches in Nnewi, Abakaliki, Onitsha and others have indicated interest to be in Asaba.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
