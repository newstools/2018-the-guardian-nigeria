We STAN the queen. Beyonce just added another reason why she is one of our favourites with her iconic Halloween look. For Halloween, the queen is recreating Toni Braxton’s 1993 debut single cover Another Sad Love Song. Not only does she strike the same poses, the cover also takes after the original design of the eponymous album. Take a look: This will not be the first time as she has done Lil Kim’s iconic looks (five in all), Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey as well as did looks from the film Coming to America. Here is what fans are saying: I also love that Beyoncé, as big as she is, never feels too big to pay homage to legends on Halloween. She has shown love to Janet Jackson, Salt N Pepa, Lil Kim and now Toni Braxton. As if she’s not Beyoncé. pic.twitter.com/3oqg47Cews — Good On Any MLK Blvd. (@eleven8) October 30, 2018  A Black QUEEN impersonating A Black QUEEN
