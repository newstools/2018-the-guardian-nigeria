Lagos state governor Akinwunmi Ambode on Tuesday said he is confident of victory for president Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate Babajide-Sanwo-Olu in next year’s general election at state and federal levels. Ambode lost the APC governorship primaries in Lagos State to Sanwo-Olu in October. Despite his failed attempt, Ambode has assured the party that he would lead the campaign to ensure victory for the party in the 2019 general elections. The governor spoke with journalists at the Presidential Wing of the Muritala Mohammed International Airport shortly after he accompanied President Buhari to perform the official commissioning of the new Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) border posts at Seme-Krake joint border post in Badagry. Ambode stated that it was important for the APC to retain its leadership positions both in the federal and the State level. “But again, just to also use this opportunity to let Lagosians know that we are heavily committed to the re-election of Mr President and you can see that his continuous visit to Lagos reiterates the fact that he is actually a lover of Lagos State and I am committed to ensuring his re-election,” Ambode said. “We are going to campaign heavily for him. I am also committed to ensuring that the APC wins the governorship election come 2019. We support the candidacy of Babajide Sanwo-Olu and we would make sure that APC retains Lagos State and the centre.” Ambode had earlier received President Buhari at the airport before the duo proceeded to Seme where the President joined his Republic of Benin counterpart, Patrice Talon to inaugurate the Border Post.
