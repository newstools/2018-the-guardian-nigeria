 Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike  Wike, who spoke in an interview at the Government House, Port Harcourt yesterday, regretted that some former governors and out-going governors expend energy and resources to impose successors on their respective states. He said the struggle to impose a governor on Rivers people was the reason behind the conflict between him and the immediate past Rivers State Governor, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi. He, however, promised not to be involved in the struggle to impose a successor if he wins and concludes his two terms as governor in 2023. “I will not support anyone dictating what will happen in Rivers State. The crisis you are seeing is the struggle to bring a successor,” he said. The governor stated that former Rivers State Governor, Dr. Peter Odili, is not involved in any form of political conflict because he has transformed into a statesman who is not desperate to impose a governor.
