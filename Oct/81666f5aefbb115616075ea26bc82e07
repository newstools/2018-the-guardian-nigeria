The former Anambra governor had earlier today arrived at Abubakar’s residence in Asokoro neighbourhood around 3:00 p.m. A source in Abubakar campaign team earlier told The Guardian that Atiku was in a meeting with Obi and also said the announcement was imminent. “We cannot confirm anything now. But Peter Obi is the most likely choice,” the source said. Obi was governor of Anambra State in Nigeria from 17 March 2006 to 2 November 2006, when he was impeached and from 9 February 2007 to 29 May 2007 after his impeachment was overturned. Although a fresh election was held on 29 April 2007, he was named governor on 14 June 2007 after a court ruling that he should be allowed to complete a four-year term. He won a 6 February 2010 election for a second term as governor To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
