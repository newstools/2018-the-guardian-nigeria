 International Oil Companies (IOCs) to relocate their administrative and operational headquarters to the Niger Delta.  The source told The Guardian that the level of interest shown by the two countries, which included a visit of the Prime Minister of Sai Tome and Principe to Nigeria recently, were indications of readiness to revive the partnership.Similarly, the source disclosed that the organisation has been restructured with new workforce, and have gathered new data on the viability of the oil deposits in the region. This discovery, the source noted, could bring back Total, Chevron, Sinopec, Addax, ExxoMobil, who had pulled out of the zone on the claims that it is difficult to drill there, and that the oil has no commercial value after drilling some wells.
      
“There is a lot of renewed interest by the oil majors in the zone. Some of the data we have now, we do not have it in the past. Also, they now have the equipment they didn’t have in past for deep offshore drilling,” the source said.
 
Furthermore, difficulties in exploring at the zone was not the only the reason that led to the pull-out of the oil majors, he said, adding that international politics as well as the oil market realities of the time created unfavourable situation for the investors.  The source debunked allegations that the organisation was running on a budget of about $12 million despite not being productive for the past 17 years.
