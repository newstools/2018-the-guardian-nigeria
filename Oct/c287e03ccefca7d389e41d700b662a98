 In this photograph taken on October 14, 1997, then South African Foreign Minister Roelof “Pik” Botha (R) shakes hands with Archbishop Desmond Tutu as he arrives at The Truth and Reconciliation Commision Hearings in Johannesburg. – Former South African foreign minister Roelof “Pik” Botha, whose long career in government straddled both the apartheid era and the presidency of Nelson Mandela, has died aged 86, local media reported October 12, 2018. Botha served as foreign minister for 17 years until the end of apartheid in 1994, and then joined Mandela’s cabinet after the end of white-minority rule and the country’s first non-racial election in 1994.

His foundation “wishes to thank all who have sent messages and prayers, including on social media, for the Arch’s swift return to his feet,” it said. The Nobel Peace laureate was taken to hospital in Cape Town on September 27 for tests. No further updates about his health were released. He was hospitalised four times in 2016 and underwent minor surgery for a persistent infection linked to the prostate cancer treatment he has received for nearly two decades. The much-loved former archbishop of Cape Town gained worldwide prominence for his strong opposition to apartheid white-minority rule in South Africa. He won the Nobel Peace Price in 1984. Tutu has retired from public life but last month issued a statement confirming his support for the “right to die” after a South African campaigner was charged with murder over the assisted suicide of a quadriplegic man.
