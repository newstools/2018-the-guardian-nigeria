The operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos State police command have re–arrested a robbery suspect five days after he was released from Ikoyi Prisons. The suspect, Tunde Okunola, 26, was re–arrested in Marwa Roundabout, Lekki with an accomplice, Segun Adigun, 27, while trying to rob one Gift Omini at about 4:45a.m. last Wednesday. While the duo were arrested in the morning, another robbery gang operating on motorcycle, Raimi Fatai, 16 and Yusuph Balogun, 22, was arrested on Wednesday night at the National Stadium, Surulere after snatching a handbag from a lady. Okunola, who was released from Ikoyi Prisons on Friday, October 5, was re-arrested after robbing Omini of her mobile phone while riding on the motorcycle popularly known as okada. Okunola, in his statement to the police disclosed that he had spent six months and two weeks in Ikoyi Prisons before being released days before nemesis again caught up with him after committing another crime. The suspect, while pleading with the police, said he is a trained barber and was looking for funds to secure freedom from his boss in Lagos. He added that if released, he would run away from Lagos. The victim, Omini, had told the police that the suspects, who were riding okada, used a short axe to dispossess her of a mobile phone. “My shout for help attracted the attention of RRS officers at the roundabout and they chased after them and arrested them.” For Fatai and Balogun arrested by RRS officials after a chase at Surulere, they also disclosed that they live in Boundary, Ajegunle and that they were trying to raise money for freedom after undergoing training as barbers. Speaking on the development, the command’s Public Relations Officer, CSP Chike Oti, said the police was not unaware of criminal elements that would want to seize the opportunity of the coming festive period to engage in crime. He added that the command is leaving no stone unturned to make Lagos unconducive for criminals.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
