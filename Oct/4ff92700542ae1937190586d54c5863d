F & R Projects recently held an event to commemorate the International Day of the Girl Child, which was observed worldwide on Thursday, 11th of October, 2018. UNICEF statistics report that over 60% of out-of-school children in Nigeria are girls. Statistics like this go to show the glaring inequality in the welfares of boy and girl children and so necessitates action on the path of well-meaning individuals, who can afford to do more than just speak about these issues. The Day of Girls event saw the organisation partner with Slum2School, to organize a book reading with over 100 underprivileged school girls between ages 11-16 from schools all around Lagos state. This project is funded primarily by the support and donations of corporate and individual patrons with the aim of creating a better world for everyone by actively working to improve the welfare and enforce the human rights of the girl child. F&R Projects And Slum2School #InternationalDayOfTheGirlChild Girls at this event were opportune to meet with successful women and some of their favourite female celebrities who read, mentored these girls and handed out back to school packs and books provided by the donations of the Patrons, to encourage and facilitate literacy of the girl child. we had a Live art installation with artist and curator, Sunshine Alaibe.
