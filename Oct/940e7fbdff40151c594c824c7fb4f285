No fewer than 200 Nigerians will benefit from a one-month free screening and surgical operations for prostate cancer, kidney stones, gall stones and gynecological problems. The exercise, which is being sponsored by the Surgical Aid Foundation (SAF) in conjunction with Kelina Hospital, Gwarinpa, Abuja, is to enable poor patients to access hi-tech surgeries. “With the adoption of western diets by most Nigerians, increased stress in a modern world, diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are on the increase. “Some of these are responsible for increased renal failure.
