An Abuja high court Tuesday ruled that the looter’s list released by the Federal Government in March was not in violation of the rights to presumption of innocence of those named. Founder of the African Independent Television and Ray Power Radio, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, filed a suit against the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed seeking a declaration of the looters’ list as void. Justice Olukayode Adeniyi said the suit lacked merit stating that the released list of the alleged looters by Lai Mohammed on behalf of the Federal Government is without any force of law. The judge added that since the minister is neither the judge or the prosecutor in the criminal case pending before the Federal High Court against Dokpesi, there was no merit to the suit. He advised that if aggrieved by the possible injury done to the plaintiff, he should rather seek a remedy through a libel/slander suit. The court on Tuesday adjourned the libel suit initiated by Dokpesi against the minister till November 9. It also dismissed the minister’s objection to the libel suit and scheduled a hearing of the substantive suit for November 9 due to the absence of Minister Mohammed’s lawyers in court.
