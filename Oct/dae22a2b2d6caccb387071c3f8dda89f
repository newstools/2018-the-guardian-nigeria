The Nigeria Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has reopened the Osubi Airport in Warri, Delta State, to flights operations after a two-month closure. The redeployment of Air Traffic Controllers and aeronautical services yesterday brought the usual hustle and bustle to the airstrip, with no fewer than three nonscheduled aircraft touching down.The Guardian had on Wednesday reported revenue losses to airlines, firms and passengers since NAMA closed the airport on September 3, 2018 over alleged indebtedness of N500 million by Shoreline Oil Services, managers of the facility. Shoreline, however, contested the figures. Managing Director of the facility, Femi Oyediran, confirmed the reopening, adding that the debt claims and charges due to NAMA were yet to be resolved.Also, Arik Air has announced the resumption of flight operations to Osubi Airport, with effect from Friday, October 26, 2018. Arik Air operates two flights daily from Lagos to Warri and one from Abuja to Warri. Chief Executive Officer of the airline, Roy Ilegbodu, said he was pleased to welcome passengers back on the Lagos-Warri and Abuja-Warri routes, promising on-time departures and delightful customer experience.
