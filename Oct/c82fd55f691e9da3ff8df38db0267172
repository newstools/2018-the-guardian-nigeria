As part of activities commemorating White Cane Day, Federal Nigeria Society for the Blind (FNSB), Lagos, yesterday, performed eyes screening for over 100 commercial bus drivers and other citizens in Ojuelegba, Lagos. White Cane Day is marked yearly to serve as a reminder of the essential humanity of visually impaired persons and ensure the public support them to live independent, happy and meaningful lives, while giving back to their communities. Speaking at the programme, Chairman, White Cane Safety Day committee and council member of FNSB, Yinka Akande, said bringing the screening to motor park is very strategic, as a number of blind students have problem boarding busses because drivers and conductors are not sympathetic towards their cause. “The eye screening is targeted at the drivers, because many of them also have failing eyesight without knowing,” he said. He called for equal respect for the visually challenged persons, as they would to other members of the society. Akande, who led students on a walk from the National Stadium, Surulere to Ojuelegba, called on the National Assembly to pass the disability law. Chief Olu Falomo, a trustee, said: “Everywhere in the world, the government champions this cause, but it is a different thing here. Go to Ghana, everybody there knows what to do when they see a blind person.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
