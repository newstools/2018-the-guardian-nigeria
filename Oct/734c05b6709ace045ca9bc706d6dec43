AFP PHOTO / PIUS UTOMI EKPEI National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has said that over 180 victims of human trafficking are brought back to Nigeria every week. This was revealed yesterday at the inaugural interactive session organised by Beauty In Every Life Initiative, a non-governmental organisation focused on creating awareness about the dangers in trafficking of women and children. The south west zonal commander of NAPTIP, Daniel Atokolo, said that 180 victims of human trafficking, mostly women and children, were brought back to the country on Thursday, October 25, from The Netherlands, Europe, Germany, and that another 180 were expected back home this Thursday. “We are expecting to receive in our care another 180 victims of human trafficking this week and we are hoping to have more of them back home for proper sensitisation and empowerment,” he said. Atokolo also warned families to desist from unofficial hiring of domestic staff, which he described as a major means of human slavery. His words: “House-owners must go through registered firms to hire cooperate domestic helps, instead of enslaving young girls from the villages. This is a major form of human slavery and we are against it.” According to the commander, the agency is collaborating with customs, police and federal ministries, while calling on members of the public to report any case of human abuse and help sensitise people on the dangers of human trafficking.
