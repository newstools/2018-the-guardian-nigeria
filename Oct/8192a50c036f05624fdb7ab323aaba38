You need to decide if it is an all-white party or an old-school party or a costume party. You can always look up creative themes for a party on Google if you in a bind. Create a guest list for the party. Write down the name of people you intend to invite. This information will help you plan for other tasks like the food at the party or the size of the venue. Grab a calendar and select a date and time for the party. Accomplishing this task will make you more goal-oriented as you have defined the date and time f0r the party. You have to decide if you want to have your party with open blue skies or in a confined environment like a hall. The theme will indirectly affect your decision on what kind of party you should have. The decision of a venue will be weighing heavily on the theme or nature, indoor vs outdoor, of the party. The type of invitation is dependent on the theme of the party. You don’t necessarily have to break the bank to send an invite instead you can always send a paperless invite via email or social media. The decision of what food or drinks to serve at the party depends on whether it is an indoor or outdoor event, theme and your “budget”. You also have to decide if you need an anchor for the party, comedian, musician, DJ or clown at the party to entertain your guest. This decision is weighing heavily on your budget. An inexpensive way of entertaining your guests is playing songs from your laptop or mobile phone. Parties can be very tasking so ask for help from friends or hire people to assist you in executing various tasks. Cross check the venue, food vendors and entertainment the day before the party. Ensure you get a friend or hire someone to manage the logistics of serving the food and drinks during the party. Wake up early, get dressed and go to the venue early to welcome your guests. Most especially don’t stress yourself and make sure you enjoy the party to the fullest.
