However, the Amputee Eagles were defeated 3-0 by Russia on Tuesday at San Juan de los Lagos, Jalisco, Mexico. Meanwhile, in the other Group E fixture Brazil defeated El Salvador 1-0. The Special Eagles still have a game to play against El Salvador to complete their journey at the tournament in Mexico. The game effectively a dead rubber will provide an opportunity for Nigeria to salvage some pride. Africa’s other representative, Kenya came from behind to defeat USA 2-1 in their group game.
