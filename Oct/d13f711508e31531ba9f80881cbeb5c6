The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has presented the certificate of return to Osun State governor-elect Gboyega Oyetola. Oyetola, a candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, was declared the winner of the Osun State governorship election, which was concluded last Thursday after a rerun. Oyetola polled 255,505 votes to defeat People’s Democratic Party’s candidate, Ademola Adeleke, who got 255,023 votes. He received the certificate of return at the INEC office in Osogbo, the State’s capital on Wednesday from INEC’s Director of Legal Services, Oluwatoyin Babalola, who represented the Chairman of the commission, Prof Mahmood Yakubu. Receiving the certificate, Oyetola commended INEC and security agencies for doing a great job during the poll, with a promise to make the welfare of the people the focus of his administration. Oyetola said, “We will ensure that our programmes are people-friendly. The main focus of our administration will be the welfare of the people. I must not fail to recognise the governor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, for giving me the opportunity to serve. “I have been a private person but the opportunity given me to serve in the public service was a great one.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
