Canadian multi-award winner Drake has broken another music record which has been unbeaten for a very long time. Drizzy has the highest number of top 10 songs in the Us charts in a year. The Canadian rap star has broken a record held by English rock band the Beatles in 1964. His 12 top 10 Billboard charts hits in 2018 has made it possible to break the Beatles’ record. This achievement is an early birthday gift of some sort as he celebrates his 32nd birthday on 24 October. Drake performing.
