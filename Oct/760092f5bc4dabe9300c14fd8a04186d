Speaking with The Guardian after his girls’ loss to Edo Dynamos, Owena Queens’ coach, Olalude Tommy blamed fatigue for the defeat. “Our defeat was as a result of fatigue because we played a match just yesterday (Sunday). The next thing is for us to have confidence in ourselves and believe that we can win our subsequent matches by the grace of God. “They girls need to be encouraged and also rest well so that they can recover fully for their next game. In this championship, we were not opportune to have our best legs, as many of them were in school either sitting for their exams or doing one thing or the other.
