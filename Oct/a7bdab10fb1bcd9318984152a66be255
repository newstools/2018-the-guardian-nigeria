Speaking about the production, Producer and writer, Funke Sodade described the play as an inspired production that all Nigerians must see. “The Anthem’ is a very rich story about Nigeria that draws characterisation from the National Anthem. We are delivering an epic tale that portrays a utopian Nigeria where fault lines do not exist. In between rehearsals, it’s been an inspired atmosphere even among the cast and crew. We are pumped up about what Nigerians and non-Nigerians alike are about to see in The Anthem.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
