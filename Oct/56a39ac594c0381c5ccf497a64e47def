NNPC tower The Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru, yesterday, denied cash transfer to the President Muhammadu Buhari Campaign Organisation for the purpose of funding the media/publicity leg of the exercise. Reacting to an allegation on the matter, NNPC’s General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said the allegation was politically-motivated and the accusation only found accommodation in the subconscious of some mischievous political actors who were determined to drag the corporation and its GMD into the arena of partisan political tussle. The corporation said: “The allegation was not only false, but runs against the prevailing gale of transparency and accountability pervading the operations of the NNPC since the advent of the current administration. “With no regard for the cherished investigative reporting ethos of balance and confirmation of story, the allegation, without doubt, come across as a kindergarten execution of an ill-thought political brinksmanship.” NNPC called on all well-meaning members of the public and oil and gas industry stakeholders to disregard the report, noting that its management is focused on delivering the aspiration of the current administration.
