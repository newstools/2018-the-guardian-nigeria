OHK Entertainment presents a collaboration between Skales and ace hitmaker of DJ Princes’ ’Shaku Shaku’, Popito. Skales teams up with Popito to release an entertaining new single ‘Gbana’. ‘Gbana’ is exactly what you would expect a track solely produced to get you moving to be. The lyrics, inviting us to roll our waists, are catchy, and the tempo is fast-paced. The video was directed by LUCASRIED, and is fun and vibrant, featuring graffiti, and some of our favourite outfits from the 90s. Skales and Popito bring an energy that makes us want to get up and jump right into the video with them. No doubt we’ll be jamming to this one for a while.
