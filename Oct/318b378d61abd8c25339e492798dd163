President Made False Declaration – Aborisade The National Democratic Front (NDF) has described recent dust being raised on President Muhammadu Buhari’s certificate saga as “unnecessary and needless campaign of calumny” by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to divert attention from serious issues affecting the country. In a press statement made available to journalists in Abuja, NDF national president, Comrade Audu Auwulu said his organisation is not surprised that, instead of addressing any of the numerous challenges facing the country, the opposition party is making attempt to trivialise the presidential contest. But a human rights lawyer, Comrade Femi Aborisade, has said the claim by President Muhammadu Buhari on his certificate is false.In a statement made available to The Guardian, Aborisade said: “By the public statement of the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Olajide Olaleye, to the effect that the Army neither has the originals of school certificate and statement of result nor their certified true copies in the personal file of President Muhammadu Buhari, contrary to Mr. President’s claim, it is beyond controversy that the President has made a false claim. “On the basis that he was elected in 2015 on the claim of an above average moral authority, the credibility of Mr. President would appear to have suffered, as far as the quality that stood him out and made him the choice of the average electorate, irrespective of ethnic and religious affiliation in that election is concerned. “The desperation to occupy public office is partly informed by limitless access to public vaults, excessive privileges and power to dispense favours to private individuals and companies at the expense of public interests. We need to make public office unattractive on the basis of opportunity for primitive accumulation of wealth.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
