Last November, there were rumours that the “A Star Is Born” actress thanked her “fiancé Christian” during her emotional and empowering speech at Elle’s 25th Annual Women in Hollywood Celebration in Los Angeles. Although it is unsure when exactly Christian popped the big question, Lady Gaga has been spotted wearing a sparkler on her left-hand ring finger for months now, fueling the speculation that she is indeed an engaged Lady. Lady Gaga who is known for her flamboyance has managed to keep her romance with Christian relatively low key save for the occasional joint public appearance.

More than six months after the split, Gaga was spotted canoodling with Christian on the field at the 2017 Super Bowl in early February and the low-key couple has been going strong ever since.
