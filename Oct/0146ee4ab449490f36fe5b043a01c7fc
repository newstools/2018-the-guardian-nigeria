He said the Federal Government still has some days to engage organised labour on a meaningful and sincere discussion on the new national minimum wage to avert strike. Salako, a member of the tripartite committee on minimum wage negotiation, told The Guardian that there was no different figure as put by some social partners but a recommended figure of N30,000 by the committee. He said: “We have one figure that is recommended and adopted by the tripartite committee on October 5, 2018. So, there are no different figures. If they are not able to pay, that is a different ball game, but to say there are different figures from states, Federal Government or Labour is not it.” Salako described the “no work, no pay” rule by the Federal Government as offensive and an attack on workers’ right.
