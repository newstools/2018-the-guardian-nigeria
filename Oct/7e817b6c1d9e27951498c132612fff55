Last year, a Nigerian-German writer Efua Traoré was selected as one of the five regional winners for the 2018 Commonwealth Short Story Prize, from 5,182 entries and a shortlist of 24 stories. Traoré wrote a piece titled, True Happiness, which described a fiction story of how “a troubled 13-year-old boy in Lagos questions his pastor’s definition of true happiness.” Founded in 2012, the Commonwealth Short Story Prize is awarded annually for the best piece of unpublished short fiction and opens to Commonwealth citizens aged 18 and over.
