 TORONTO, ON – AUGUST 09: Rafael Nadal of Spain celebrates victory over Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland during a 3rd round match on Day 4 of the Rogers Cup at Aviva Centre on August 9, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.   Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images/AFP  The 32-year-old Anderson became the first South African singles player in over two decades to qualify for the end-of-season event with his victory over Kei Nishikori in Sunday’s final. Rafael Nadal’s position at the top will come under threat at this week’s Paris Masters from Novak Djokovic, who arrives on an 18-match winning run after triumphs in Cincinnati, the US Open and Shanghai. The Spaniard is returning to action for the first time since hobbling out of the semi-finals in New York and must match Djokovic’s result in France to remain as world number one. Roger Federer is still third after his 99th career title at Basel, while runner-up Marius Copil of Romania soared to a career-high 60th after shooting up 33 places. Latest ATP rankings: 1.
