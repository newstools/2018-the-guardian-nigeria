Boxing fans, who witnessed the much-talked about ‘Chaos in Lagos,’ an event put together by Kwese and Kalakoda Boxing Promotions, at the Federal Palace Hotel, Victoria Island, on Friday night were thrilled by the spectacular display by Nigerian sensation, Tony ‘Sugar’ Salam, in his WBF African Cruiserweight title fight against Chomunorwa ‘Sting’ Gonorenda from Zimbabwe. The Nigerian lived up to his pre-match boasting by winning the title in the night of boxing entertainment, which featured six bouts in different weight divisions. The bout between Tony ‘Sugar’ Salam, and Chomunorwa ‘Sting’ Gonorenda from Zimbabwe was one of the three international contests. Salam who was denied victory when both fighters met in Harare, Zimbabwe, in August, controlled the fight from the inception and gave his teeming fans a lot to cheer before the champion was beaten to submission in the sixth round of the 10-round fight via a technical knockout. An elated Salam said after the fight: “I was determined not to give him any breathing space. That was my lesson from the first fight two months ago in Harare. My plan was to knock him out earlier, but Gonorenda proved he is not a push over. I really thank my fans who stood behind me till this moment, and I will like to assure them that the setback I had in Harare will not repeat itself again.” In the other bouts, Olanrewaju Durodola knocked out Maroy Sadiki in the second round of their 12-round contest in the WBF Cruiserweight World title fight, just as Habib Ahmed beat Sunday Ajunwa in round three of the eight round contest of the International Super Middleweight bout. Rilwan Lawal won the Featherweight bout against Dare Oyewole in an unanimous decision, just as Taiwo Olowu outclassed Saheed Lawal in the Welterweight contest via a technical knockout in round four. Sadiq Adeleke edged out Tunde Olojede in the Bantamweight challenge via a split decision. The General Manager for Kwesé TV Nigeria, Elizabeth Amkpa, said that the organisation would continue to support African boxing through the Kwesé Friday Fight Nights, which usually take place every last Friday of the month in different cities across the continent.
