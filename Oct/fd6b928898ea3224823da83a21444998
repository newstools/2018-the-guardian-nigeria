 [FILE PHOTO] Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, the Governor of Lagos State.<br />Photo: Twitter/ AkinwunmiAmbode  Speaking at the 3rd Lagos State Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Fair, Ambode, represented by the Commissioner for Special Duties, Seye Oladejo, said the sector’s potential is the reason his administration deemed it expedient to put in place policies, projects and programmes aimed at ameliorating the gamut of challenges being faced by the MSME sector. Speaking on the theme of the fair, ‘Enhancing the Quality of MSMEs’ Products for Global Competitiveness’, he said: “One of such programmes is the MSME Exclusive Fair which is the flagship trade fair and exhibition in the State that gives indigenous small businesses increased leverage for local market access and global visibility.” [AD] He therefore called for collaboration between the Organised Private Sector (OPS) and government as a means of growing the potentials of the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector in terms of wealth creation and employment generation for the country.
   
“As a people-oriented government, we shall continue to design and implement policies and programmes that would accelerate the actualization of our goals of sustainable trade, industrial and economic development. We are, therefore, emboldened to call on the Organised Private Sector to continue to collaborate with our government in our bid to enhance the quality and overall performance of our MSMEs for business prosperity and economic development of Lagos state and Nigeria as a whole.
 
“In terms of small business infrastructure, we are fast-tracking the construction of the Imota Light Industrial Park, Ikorodu which would complement existing industrial estates in the state upon completion,” said Ambode.
