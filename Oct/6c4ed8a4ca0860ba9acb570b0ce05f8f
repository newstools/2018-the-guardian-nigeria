• Urge Govt To Release Dead Bodies For Proper Burial
Following fresh outbreak of violence in Kaduna State yesterday, the people of southern part of the state, under the umbrella of Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), have called on the state government to probe the latest killings, urging the release of the bodies of their kinsmen killed during the mayhem for proper burial. A statement issued by the National Public Relations Officer of SOKAPU, Mr. Yakubu Kuzamani, said: “We make a passionate appeal on the government to set up an impartial probe panel to investigate the Kasuwan Magani massacre that led to scores of deaths and fish out the instigators of the crisis. “We are aware that bereaved families are yet to receive bodies for decent burials. We urge relevant security agencies to ensure release of these bodies to their relatives for proper burial according to each faith. “The carnage at Kasuwan Magani that led to the death of many is unfortunate. We commiserate with families of the dead and the injured and pray to God for quick healing. “We are also sad with the happening within the metropolis on Sunday, October 21.” He added: “We are very worried at the suspicious incidents occurring around our traditional institutions. In the space of 11 months, the Etum Numana was assassinated, the Agom Akulu was kidnapped and now the Agom Adara was brutally kidnapped and killed, as were some of his aides.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
