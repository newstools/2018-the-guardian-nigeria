Nigeria and China are to deepen relationship through intensive cultural exchange. The commitment was struck yesterday when a 13-man Chinese delegation led by the Director, China Cultural Centre, Li Xuda, paid a courtesy visit to Heritage Africa Village Square (HAvis) in Abuja. Xuda, who is also the Cultural Counselor, Embassy of Peoples Republic of China, told newsmen that the two nations share similar cultural backgrounds hence his home governmentâ€™s desire to strengthen the existing ties between the two countries through culture. He noted that the Asian giant had invested heavily to create platforms where Nigerians easily learn its culture, adding that more resources and capacity building would be provided to encourage more people to participate. Chief Executive Officer of HAvis, Mr. Moses Ayom, expressed optimism that through the forum, both countries would be able to effectively project their cultures to the world.
