The National Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have blamed old age for the Corps handball players’ poor performance at the just concluded National League in Lagos. They also added that the disqualification of four female players from the league adversely affected the Corps’ performance in the championship. According to NSCDC Director of Sports, Commandant Ayodele Titus, who dismissed lack of encouragement and motivation as reason for the Corps’ failure to finish among the top three teams, the players were camped for a month before the league. “Our handball players are adequately motivated and encouraged to dominate the sport. They are on regular salary and always camped for any tournament they are listed to attend. The real issue the team had during the league in Lagos was the disqualification of four female players, and such decision affected the players,” he said. Titus, who spoke to The Guardian at the Abuja National Stadium, where he came to monitor athletes training for the forthcoming Ministry of Interior Games (MIGA) in Kaduna, lamented that players were now more interested in money rather than developing their career. Apart from the NSCDC, the Nigeria Police, Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Prison Service, Federal Fire Service and Ministry of Interior would participate in the MIGA featuring 13 sports. He, however, promised to ensure that the NSCDC retained the top position in the MIGA, saying the Corps’ athletes are being camped across the country. He revealed that the athletes, who are currently camped in Abuja, Enugu, Ogun, Kaduna and Lagos, would feature in athletics, basketball, badminton, football, handball, table tennis, karate, tennis, taekwondo, swimming, squash and volleyball.
