The Imo State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primaries legal tussle took a new turn yesterday in a suit filed by factional candidate of the party, Hope Uzodinma, before a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The court joined Governor Rochas Okorocha’s son in-law, Uche Nwosu and delegates of Owerri zone in the matter.Defendants in the suit are the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the APC. Uzodinma had last week sought an order of the court directing the APC to forward his name to INEC as the party’s authentic governorship candidate for 2019 election.He also prayed the court for another order restraining INEC from continuing to process or publish any other person’s name except that of Hope Uzodimma as governorship candidate of the APC for next year’s election.Delivering judgment on the ex parte motion, Justice Oathman Musa ordered the APC and INEC to show cause why the court should not grant Uzodinma’s prayers. The court, however, adjourned sitting till October 17, but as the the matter came up yesterday, three applicants informed the court of their applications before it seeking to be joined as parties in the suit.
