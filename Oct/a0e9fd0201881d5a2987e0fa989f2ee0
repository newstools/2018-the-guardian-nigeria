The Cardi B x Fashion Nova collection includes about 80 pieces, ranging from suiting to dresses to outerwear. The Fashion Nova brand announced that the line takes influence from the star and “the emerging global cultural icons of the late ’80s and early ’90s,” so you can expect bright hues, latex and faux fur for ultra-sexy styles.
