Banku master Mr Eazi has released his latest single Keys To The City (Ogede). A brilliant video centred on the current political environment (in Nigeria), it reflects the African mentality and political structure. It also shows the ideals that are held by the governments while he beckons on the people not to sell their votes. The visuals was directed by Meji Alabi.
