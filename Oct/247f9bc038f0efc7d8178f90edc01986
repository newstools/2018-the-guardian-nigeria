Off her performance with the American Music Awards, Mariah Carey releases the video of “With You.” Her first video from her 15th album expected to be out this year, the white and black video reminds us of the beautiful vocals of the award-winning diva. Some of its clips show Mariah on her oceanfront property and in a vintage car. The video was directed by Sarah McColgan (“GTFO”).
