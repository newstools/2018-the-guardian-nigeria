Tradegy struck yesterday at Iyana Isolo, on Oshodi-Apapa expressway, Lagos, after a truck, which was involved in a lone accident, left one person dead. It was gathered that the truck, without a registration number, was heading towards Cele. However, in the driver’s bid to negotiate a bend on reaching Iyana Isolo under-bridge, the truck entered a failed portion. A trader under the bridge, Babatunde Jonah, explained: “This is not the first time cars would be involved in accident here because of the bad spot, but none has claimed life as today’s. “When the truck got here (pointing at the bad spot), the truck head got stuck. While the driver was trying to riddle his way out, the faulty truck shifted from where it was. Unfortunately, the motor boy got stuck in between. We only heard him exclaimed ye! When the driver was alerted, he stopped but nobody could rescue the boy. He died on the spot because, he was motionless”. The incident hampered the free flow of traffic along the route. Policemen from Ilasamaja division arrived the scene to control traffic, before the truck was evacuated with a crane.
