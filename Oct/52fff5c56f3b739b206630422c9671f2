Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic moved a step closer to a possible face off in the final of the on-going Shanghai Open tennis tournament when the top seeded Federer outlasted Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut 6/2; 2/6; 6/4 and Djokovic defeated Italy’s Marco Cecchinatto, 6/4; 6/0. Also through to the quarterfinals are Kei Nishikori, Alexander Zverev, Borna Coric, Kyle Edmund, Kevin Anderson and Matthew Ebden Federer had a repeat of his previous match in which he had a narrow three-set victory over Daniil Medvedev. In his third round match, he took the first set from Spain’s Agut, but trailed all through the second, which he dropped 6/2. The Swiss got one service break to take the decider 6/4. The day’s thriller was the face-off between Alexander Zverev and the teenager Alex De Minaur. Zverev delivered two aces, and two winners to take the opening game. De Minaur dropped the frist point on his serve but held.  The German star took the next five games. In the second set, the Aussie led 30-0 and took the first game. At three games apiece, Zverev got the service break to lead 4-3.  He then saved two break points and held for 5-3. Although the Aussie held for 4-5, he won the 10th game with an ace. America’s Sam Querrey led seven points to six in the first set tie break, but Kei Nishikori cancelled it. A net-cord gave Nishikori a short ball, which he put away for a winner to lead 8-7. He won his next service point to take first set and won the second set 6/4 on a break of Querrey’s serve. The second seeded Juan Martin Del Potro sustained knee injury from a fall on court and lost the first set 5-7. He could not continue as he retired. It was a sad ending for his campaign in Asia.
