As the world celebrates World Mental Health Day, the British Prime Minister Theresa May, Wednesday, appointed Jackie Doyle-Price as minister for suicide prevention. Doyle-Prince, who is also a Conservative Member of Parliament and the health minister is the first ever minister for suicide prevention. “We can end the stigma that has forced too many to suffer in silence. We can prevent the tragedy of suicide taking too many lives,” May said. According to a new report by WHO, suicide is the second leading cause of death globally for young people aged between 15 and 19. The report also suggested there is little difference reported in mental health services and support between countries of low and middle average incomes and those of high incomes. The appointment of Doyle-Price is one of the UK government’s efforts to confront the issue. The new role will see Doyle-Price head up a ministerial taskforce, work with experts in suicide and self-harm prevention, charities, clinicians and those personally affected by suicide. “In my time as health minister, I have met many people who have been bereaved by suicide and their stories of pain and loss will stay with me for a long time,’ the minister said. “It’s these people who need to be at the heart of what we do and I welcome this opportunity to work closely with them, as well as experts, to oversee a cross-government suicide prevention plan, making their sure their views are always heard.” According to Dr. Pattel of Harvard University, Mental health disorders have “dramatically risen” around the world in the last 25 years and described the global mental health situation as “extremely bleak.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
