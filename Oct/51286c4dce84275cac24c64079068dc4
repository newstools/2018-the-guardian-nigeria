Nigeria’s Hauwa Ojeifo, founder of She Writes Woman, has been nominated for the first-ever MTV EMA Generation Change Award, an award that recognises young people who are making efforts to change the world. Speaking on the nomination, the 26-year-old Queen’s Young Leader awardee told Guardian Life, Honestly, it’s incredibly humbling to realise that the work we do through She Writes Woman is being recognised halfway across the world. I’m just happy to see the shift in how people receive the topic of mental health and sexual violence. #GenerationSafe to me, is raising a generation that creates Safe places you can talk without fear and be heard without judgment. So I pray we win this at #MTVEMA <img class="aligncenter wp-image-771180 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/QueenElizabethIIHauwaOjeifoMajestyHostsxDDXb9F_1Hzl-443x598.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1351" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/QueenElizabethIIHauwaOjeifoMajestyHostsxDDXb9F_1Hzl-443x598.jpg 443w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/QueenElizabethIIHauwaOjeifoMajestyHostsxDDXb9F_1Hzl-412x557.jpg 412w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/QueenElizabethIIHauwaOjeifoMajestyHostsxDDXb9F_1Hzl-178x240.jpg 178w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/QueenElizabethIIHauwaOjeifoMajestyHostsxDDXb9F_1Hzl-355x480.jpg 355w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/QueenElizabethIIHauwaOjeifoMajestyHostsxDDXb9F_1Hzl.jpg 444w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Others nominees include Sonita uses her rap songs and her powerful voice to help end the scourge of child marriage, supports girls’ right to choose their own destiny and inspire people to dream big.
