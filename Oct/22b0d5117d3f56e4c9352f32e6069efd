The Chairman, Economic and Financial Crime Commission, Ibrahim Magu The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, has dissociated self from a purported audio recording in which he allegedly said he was not bothered if the former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose dies in EFCC custody. A former deputy national publicity secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Timi Frank, said there was an ongoing plot to harm Fayose while in detention with EFCC. “A Senior staff of the agency last night had to call attention of some opposition leaders to the instruction given to the agency by the presidency to ensure that Fayose does not leave EFCC custody a healthy person,” Frank said in a statement. Fayose reported to the EFCC office on Tuesday to answer questions on the alleged receipt of N1.2 billion from a former national security adviser, Sambo Dasuki, through a former minister of state for defence, Musiliu Obanikoro. “Members of the public are advised to disregard this disingenuous creation an handiwork of mischief makers intent on distracting the EFCC from the serious work of wrapping up the investigation into the corruption allegations against Fayose,” EFCC said in a statement. “The audio recording is fake as the comments did not emanate from the Chairman of the EFCC,” he added.
