Opeyemi Michael Bamidele, The Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Ekiti Central Senatorial District, Mr. Michael Opeyemi Bamidele, has offered an insight into the crises rocking the party across the country. Bamidele, who spoke at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, said APC’s prospect of sweeping the poll in 2019 was responsible for infighting among the party’s chieftains. He said: “It is characteristic of any party that is most likely to win a general election, especially the ruling party. I am sure if APC had not won the election, we probably would not have many aspirants showing interest in contesting election to various offices. In the same vein, were APC not in control of power at the centre, we probably would not have these aspirants across the country showing interest.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
