There, it blocks an inhibitory neurotransmitter, causing a stimulant effect which not only improves your energy level, mood, vigilance and various other aspects of brain function. All in all, it makes a smarter you. Almost every commercial fat burning supplement has caffeine added as one of its ingredients. This is because caffeine is counted among one of the few natural substances known to aid fat burning. One way by which caffeine burns fat is to break down body fat thereby making free fatty acid available as fuel. Theophylline is a drug used by asthmatics which allows one to breathe easier. A study published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine has shown that caffeine seems to serve the same purpose as the drug. Call them close cousins. An undepressed you is a happier you. A study published in Harvard, 2011, showed a 20% lower risk of being depressed.
Are you a lover of caffeine, do not be too worried, for it is as beneficial as the other beverage.
