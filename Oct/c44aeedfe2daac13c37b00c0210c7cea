I think the victory certainly hurt me much more psychologically than my injury,” Koscielny told Canal Plus. “The World Cup will remain a dark stage of my career and my life.” “I think I’ve given what I could to the France team. I’m 33 now. I’ve been to two Euros, a World Cup. For me, my injury hasn’t changed anything,” he said. “It’s over with Les Bleus. I will always be a France supporter but what is sure is that I will never put on the blue shirt again.” Koscielny has yet to return for Arsenal since hurting himself during the second leg of last season’s Europa League semi-final defeat by Atletico Madrid. “I have a new mindset. There will be the Laurent before and the Laurent after the injury. I want to carry on at Arsenal and I want to come back soon,” he said. “I don’t know what level I’m going to have because I haven’t resumed training yet, but I want to fight in any event.” Koscielny made his France debut in November 2011 in a friendly against the United States. He earned the last of his 51 caps in a 3-1 victory over Russia in March. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
