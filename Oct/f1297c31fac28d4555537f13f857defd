This was still a peaceful protest. How can I be treated like this in a country I have fought for and invested in? This is madness, I came with words they answered with bullets,” Murray-Bruce said. “We will peacefully struggle to get his stolen mandate restored to him.” Melaye also posted pictures of himself and a Police officer in a tussle whom he said physically molested him during the protest. “Evidence of the attack on me by the police. I was molested physically and teargassed. We demand Justice.” But following this accusation by the PDP leaders, the police spokesman, Jimoh Moshood alleged they disrupted public peace and public safety, and forcefully entered the Force Headquarters to damage and destroy Police equipment and Government properties “Senator Bukola Saraki, Senator Dino Melaye and Senator Ben Bruce who were captured on camera to have been involved in the disturbance of public peace and public safety, unlawful blockade of Shehu Shagari way for several hours preventing motorists, road users and other members of the public from having access and passage on the highway,” Moshood said. “The Inspector General of Police has directed an immediate investigation into this unprovoked and unwarranted attack on the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force and the Force Headquarters premises which is against the law and condemnable,” he added.
