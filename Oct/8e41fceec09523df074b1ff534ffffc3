 Anita Kouassigan  About challenges and rejection, that is a given when you are trying to set up something new. I don’t allow that to scare me though, otherwise that will lead to failure. For example, when someone says ‘you can’t do that’, or ‘you’ll never make it’. You have to believe you can do something, then you just get on and do it. No matter what obstacles come in the way, you mustn’t give up easily. I tend to be quite conservative in my day-to-day living, but when it comes to taking risks with my work, I’m a huge rebel. A rebel with a cause. (Laughs). Of course, there has to be a very good reason for me to be taking that risk. With Minerva Recruitment it was to help jobseekers (including some extremely helpless ones) connect with employers. With Time Out Nigeria there was a need for a listings magazine and guide that showcased what Nigerian cities had to offer tourists and business travellers. The magazine also served as a platform to write about our creative sector- artists, musicians, people in the film industry. Anita Kouassigan has embarked on a few start-ups and would like to share how her various work engagements complement each other, plus her attitude towards overcoming the challenges – or the rejections – faced by many entrepreneurs, especially at the inception stage.
