Nnedi Okorafor has come under fire for allegedly discouraging an upcoming writer. The US-based professor who is behind the writings of three issues of Marvel’s Black Panther comic book responded to a tweet of a twitter user @OniZay who stated that she is” going to be one of the best writers to come out of Nigeria” with “Talk Is Cheap.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-770296 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nnedi-Okoroafor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nnedi-Okoroafor.jpg 750w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nnedi-Okoroafor-519x598.jpg 519w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nnedi-Okoroafor-484x557.jpg 484w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nnedi-Okoroafor-208x240.jpg 208w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nnedi-Okoroafor-417x480.jpg 417w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nnedi-Okoroafor-521x600.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Her response did not go down well with some Nigerians who felt that she was blatantly rude. @Nnedi pic.twitter.com/qd3cc7RtES — C. (@chidirim_) October 22, 2018  ‘Go write’ is shorter than ‘Talk is Cheap’ You think you are slick and you want to try and spin it like you tried to when you shaded Tomi Adeyemi. You ain’t slick Nnedi Okoroafor. https://t.co/3yKBsmYRdL — Fat Belly ‘Nenye (@The_Nenye) October 22, 2018  That’s not a clap back. Love Nnedi, but that unsolicited reply was out of pocket. If emotional intelligence is key, Nnedi lacked it first. There are 1001 ways to motivate people, sensitively. The burden of E-intelligence shouldn’t be on the Onizay. But I get your point. https://t.co/LJf8u8Wu2z — Chidi Okereke (@Chydee) October 22, 2018  Nnedi’s books so far haven’t been my cup of tea but I’ve always still supported and respected her as a Nigerian writer. But sis really said “talk is cheap” to someone who even mentioned her name amongst the greats, that’s wild — Piña Colada (@Rume__) October 22, 2018  Meanwhile, Okorafor begs to differ and insists that it was a form of encouragement: A little confused as to whether @Nnedi meant this as encouragement https://t.co/H2dYdaPokA — Shimmer (@AllyShimmer) October 22, 2018  yup. i did.
it’s something i tell students all the time. it means “go write”.
but twitter is twitter. — Nnedi Okorafor, PhD (@Nnedi) October 22, 2018  What’s wrong with Nnedi’s response? I don’t get it. — Ms. N (@Nduta__) October 22, 2018  You could view that Nnedi tweet as motivation too. Let’s not move too fast abeg. — Abass. (@AbassUmana) October 22, 2018  What do you think?
