PHOTO: BBC  Abubakar Muhammad, vice-chairman of the Zurmi area, said the twins were among seven people kidnapped in Dauran town. “The seven people, four male and three females were kidnapped between Saturday and Sunday,” he told BBC. “Another two people – one male, one female – were also kidnapped in Birnin Tsaba village, while three more were abducted in Moriki town, including a local government councillor.” The twins, who are 18 years old, were visiting a cousin to show her the dress code for their joint wedding in December when they were all abducted. Their father, Alhaji Abubakar Yusuf, said the gunmen invaded their sister’s house and abducted the three of them. The kidnappers had, however, contacted the twins’ parents to demand a ransom.
