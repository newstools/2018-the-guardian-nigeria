 [FILE PHOTO] Yemi Osinbajo  Osinbajo, who spoke at the independence gala night in Abuja, said he agreed with the poll reportedly conducted by the British Independent newspapers which declared Nigerians as the happiest and most optimistic people in the world. The vice president said Adeleke provided humour by dancing while Melaye made people to laugh by claiming to escape assassination by hiding on a tree top for 11 hours. Osinbajo said: “A few months ago, an important Nigerian politician, who was on his way to a trial in a court, said he was abducted. And after he escaped from his abductors, he remained hidden on a tree for 11 hours. The most interesting part of that story is that many people on the Internet started to tell stories of different birds and how long those birds could remain perched on a tree. All these were the Nigerian contributions to that story. “Yet another very important politician insists, and still insists that the most important attribute for leadership is dancing. And for those who think that this is ridiculous, at least 200,000 people voted for him in a particular election.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
