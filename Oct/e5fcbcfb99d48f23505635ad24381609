 David Awe (left) and Joshua Nwobodo  The national championship, which took place at the National Mathematical Centre, Kwali, Abuja, hosted 35 states with two representative candidates each. Representing Lagos State, David and Joshua displayed exceptional intelligence and self-confidence from being regional champions to winning the national championship. Other finalists included representatives from Rivers and Cross Rivers States. Expressing his gratitude, Joshua Nwobodo, thanked the organisers for giving him such a wonderful opportunity. “I want to say thank you to M.A.N for this wonderful platform through which young children like myself and David get to put into practice our mathematical skills. This competition was also a test of our confidence and endurance. Most especially, I will like to thank the academic body at Pampers for instilling in me the importance of hard work and determination in achieving excellence.”
 
Ojimmy Iyakakwa, Head teacher and Head of the Mathematics department praised the duo for their feat saying, “We are so proud of the success of David and Joshua representing our school and the state. Here, we believe in educating a total child not only in Mathematics but also in all aspects of life.
