 IATA  The International Air Transport Association (IATA), Wednesday revealed that present trends in air transport suggest passenger numbers could double to about 8.2 billion by 2037.
  
The latest update to IATA’s 20-Year Air Passenger Forecast, shows that an increasing shift Eastwards in the centre of gravity of the industry is behind the continued strong growth.Over the next two decades, the forecast anticipates a 3.5 per cent Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), leading to a doubling in passenger numbers from today’s levels.
  
Africa will grow by a CAGR of 4.6 per cent, while an extra of 199 million passengers will bring the total market available to Nigeria and other African airlines to 334 million passengers by 2037.  “No matter which growth scenario comes to pass, aviation faces infrastructure crisis. Governments must work closely with the industry, to be more ambitious in developing efficient infrastructure, fit for purpose, and offering value for money.“The world stands to benefit greatly from better connectivity. However, at this rate, airports and air traffic control will not be able to handle demand. Governments and infrastructure operators must strategically plan for the future. Decisions made now will have an impact on the value created by aviation for their regions,” said de Juniac.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
