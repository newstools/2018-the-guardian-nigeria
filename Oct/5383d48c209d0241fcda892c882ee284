A few days ago 50 cents real name Curtis Jackson claimed he bought 200 tickets for Jaruleâ€™s show just to keep the seats empty via Instagram and added a photoshopped image of himself sitting alone amid empty seats. Apparently, Jarule is not bothered by this as he takes to Twitter to file a one-line response saying, I got under 50 Cent skin. I love it!!! Adding laughter emojis. Their feud which began over a decade ago evidently is not seeing the end of it as it was reignited this year. GThe cause of the feud is unclear as each party are making different assertions to the reason. 50 cents claims it started when Jarule wrongfully accused him of stealing his jewellery while Jarule claims it started during a shoot in a studio in Queens New York. 50 cents is becoming the king of trolling as he mocks one person after another. Earlier in the year he had mocked Terry Crews or speaking up about male sexual abuse and then a few weeks earlier he had mocked Ashanti for poor ticket sales on her gig. In the middle of the year, he had a fallout with his former friend Floyd Mayweather.
