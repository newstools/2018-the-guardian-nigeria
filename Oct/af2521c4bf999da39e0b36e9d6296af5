He was admitted to a Cape Town hospital on Friday with pneumothorax, “an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall,” his foundation said in a statement. Pneumothorax is normally associated with a collapsed lung, but the foundation did not specify if that was the case. “He underwent a successful procedure this morning and it is expected that he will be discharged from hospital some time next week,” it said.
