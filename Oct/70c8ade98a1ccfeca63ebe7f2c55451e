The young artist Khalid, drops new EP, Suncity, which as described by him, is ‘the start of a new era’. ‘I’ve been working so hard to make music that really emulates what’s inside of me, and I’ve been taking risks, so hopefully, the risks pay off’ he told Billboard at the American Music Awards, where he won Favorite Male Artist for Soul/R&B. Coming in as his first project this year, following his wildly successful debut American Teen, Suncity contains 7 songs in total, led by the previously released single
Better. Collaborating with the talented and beautiful Empress Oh, also titled Suncity is the closing number. The years have been good for the R&B crooner, with him racking up a handful of Grammy nominations (Best Urban Contemporary Album, Best New Artist, Best R&B Song) and nabbing the 2017 MTV VMA for the best new artist.
