His remarks will not go down well with La Liga chief Javier Tebas, who has shown a determination to go ahead with the plans to play the match, scheduled for January 26, in Miami. FIFA’s statutes suggest that they are able to block La Liga’s plans — article 71 says the governing body “may take the final decision on the authorisation of any international match or competition.” Tebas said this week that opposition to the plans — which are supported by the two clubs involved — is “cultural”. Real Madrid has voiced their unhappiness at the ideas, and the country’s players’ association and football federation have both rejected the proposal. Spain has played its season-opening Super Cup outside the country, with Barcelona beating Sevilla in the Moroccan city of Tangiers in August. However, the idea of taking the league — and especially title contenders in Barcelona — abroad is far more contentious.
