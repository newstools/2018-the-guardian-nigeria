Its spokesman, George Akinola, told newsmen yesterday that after 58 years of Independence, the country “is shipwrecked” with indications of backwardness.

Akinola described the country’s democratic process as flawed, adding that elections could no longer guarantee either the freewill of the people or good governance.
