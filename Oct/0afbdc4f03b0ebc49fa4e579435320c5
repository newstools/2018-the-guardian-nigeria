The eight-time Olympic sprint champion and current holder of the fastest man record scored the Mariners’ third and fourth goals against Macarthur South West and celebrated with his trademark lightning bolt celebration. He scored his first in the 57th minute, putting Central Coast 3-0 up with a powerful left-footed finish. And his second goal came in the 68th minute when Bolt capitalised on a defensive error to tap home from close range. He was then substituted in the 75th minute. Bolt joined the Australian A-League club in August after trying days of training sessions at Manchester United in the English Premier League and Borrusia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga. However, fortunes seem to have smiled on the long-time professional football aspirant, 32 years old Usain Bolt who was excited after a dream start to a new career. “My first start and scoring two goals, it’s a good feeling,” Bolt said. “I’m happy I could come here and show the world I’m improving. I’m keen to be a Mariner, to play my best and get into the team.” Bolt is still on trial with the Australian A-League team, with the hope of securing a contract. The A-League season begins next weekend. Bolt’s team Central Coast will play away to Brisbane Roar on Sunday 21 October.
