Many people have been happy that entertainers, Drake and Chris Brown are no longer feuding. This comes after Chris was spotted a Drake concert and everyone realised that the duo has buried the hatchet. From fighting over Rihanna to forming a new bond, it is learnt that 29-year-old Chris Brown has shared some parenting tips with Drake who is also a single father of one. Chris welcomed his daughter, Royalty back in 2014 while Drake welcomed a son, Adonis, in October 2017. Sources close to Chris Brown claim that the “Freaky Friday” crooner gave some surprisingly sweet parenting advice to Drake by encouraging the rapper to spend as much time as possible with his child, especially while they are young, and to just be present. Chris shared with Drake that kids grow up so fast and the most valuable thing in the world to children is a parent’s time and attention. Chris Brown has a sweet relationship with his daughter who he shares with Nia Guzman. It would be recalled that Chris Brown famously dated Rihanna on and off for a number of years while Drake also had an interest in the sensational pop princess. They had a fight at a club over Drake’s alleged relationship with Rihanna but later squashed their beef. Rihanna has never admitted to dating Drake although he has been a frequent collaborator with her on a number of hit songs.
