 UNILAG  Deputy Vice Chancellor, Development Services, Prof. Folasade Ogunsola, said that the university took up the bold initiative to promote multi-disciplinary research into social problems in Africa. Speaking when the institution hosted the second Lagos Summer School in Digital Humanities attended by delegates from the Institute for Digital Humanities, Historical and Cultural Information, University of Cologne, Germany, she said: “The vice chancellor is making sure that students are exposed to the culture of research and international collaboration to aid development in the university, hence this initiative.” Ogunsola, who represented the vice chancellor at the event, said that wi-fi services would be available for all academia and students next year. According to a deputy professor in Digital Humanities at the University of Cologne, Øyvind Eide, digitalisation is the continuation of traditional thinking, discussion and presentation in oral and print systems, from all parts of the world. “It is important to have an institutional, governmental, regional and international cooperation in preserving information at the professional level for the sake of saving humanity, and for communities, family and individuals to take responsibility of maintaining research information while being conscious of their heritage and values,” he said at the event.
