FilmHouse Cinemas Limited, Nigeria’s foremost film exhibition company, has today announced its initiative to take the film experience to students across the nation, as the exhibitor continues to strive to grow the “movie-going” culture and thus develop the Nigerian entertainment industry. This initiative is aptly called “The FilmHouse Campus Tour”. The tour will be rolled out in 2 phases, with phase 1 starting on Friday, October 26, 2018. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-772760 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-1062x598.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="719" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-1062x598.jpeg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-640x360.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-320x180.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-281x158.jpeg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-562x316.jpeg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-531x299.jpeg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-487x274.jpeg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-974x547.jpeg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958-600x337.jpeg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WhatsApp-Image-2018-10-23-at-14.35.12-e1540482776958.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Phase 1 of the campus tour will see FilmHouse Cinemas bring the movie experience to 8 campuses across 8 cities of the federation, reaching an estimated 15,000 students.
