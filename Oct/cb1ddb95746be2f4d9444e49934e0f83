 Sowore<br />  This was disclosed by Malcolm Fabiyi, the director-general of the Sowore campaign. Sowore noted that he picked Rufai, who is from Jigawa State and an expert in public health intervention and his areas because his campaign team believes “that health care, population health and health economics, ranks alongside national security and power, as critical areas that a serious government must address.” He opined that Rufai was the best person to spearhead the country’s health sector. He said Rufai “will be responsible for ensuring that Nigerians have access to affordable and world-class healthcare and translating that to economic growth.” Although Sowore recently shared his 8-point plans for Nigeria during a Channel TV programme,  Politics Today, he did not mention the health sector in his eight-point agenda. He, however, mentioned that “We will have a universal health care system. Anybody can have access to a doctor no matter what, every Nigerian will have access to a doctor.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
