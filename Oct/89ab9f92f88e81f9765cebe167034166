Governor Abiola Ajimobi Gov. Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State has approved the immediate payment of outstanding salaries to state civil servants and teachers on the state government’s payroll. This is contained in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Mr Toye Arulogun, and made available to newsmen in Ibadan on Monday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that only September salary of state civil servants was outstanding. Arulogun, however, said that the approval covered September and October salaries. He restated government’s commitment to the well-being and welfare of the people of the state, noting that the payment was an indication of Ajimobi’s commitment to the welfare of the workers. The commissioner noted that Ajimobi was putting in place all measures to ensure workers in the state got their salary on or before the 25th of every month. “Before the economic meltdown, the Ajimobi’s administration used to pay on or before the 25th of every month. “During this period, workers in the state also received a 300 per cent increase in salaries between 2011 and 2015 as well as 13th month salaries for three years consecutively. “There is no doubt that this administration is strongly committed to the welfare of the people and efforts are being put in place to ensure that salaries are no longer owed,” Arulogun said. He charged workers in the state to be diligent, dedicated, devoted, committed and work assiduously toward ensuring financial sufficiency for the state. Arulogun stated that it was through the “Ajumose’’ spirit of collective responsibility of all stakeholders that the financial reengineering being embarked upon by the administration could be achieved. He recalled that the state government owed up to seven months’ salary in 2016 and the government promised to clear the backlog in due course which had been achieved.
