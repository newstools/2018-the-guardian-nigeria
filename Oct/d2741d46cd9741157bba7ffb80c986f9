Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu Nigeria’s deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu has refuted claims that he was planning to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) “In the past 24 hours, I have been inundated with calls from friends and political associates seeking clarification on the rumours of my departure from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which has dominated the media,” Ekweremadu said. Ekweremadu reportedly threatened to leave the party last week over undisclosed reasons. Speculations have it that he was aggrieved about the party’s decision to pick former Anambra state governor Peter Obi as Atiku Abubakar’s running mate. Other sources alleged that he was sidelined at the party’s last convention in Port Harcourt and that his name is missing in the Atiku/Obi presidential campaign council of the party. However, Ekweremadu has denied insinuations of him leaving the party, saying, “I’m still in PDP.” “Let it be known that my path in politics is in the hands of the Almighty God, who has indeed been very faithful and gracious to me. I’m very grateful to God for this.” The deputy Senate President, who did not state his grievances said, his “vision in politics is a system that works for everybody, a social and political environment where everybody, every section, and every tribe not only counts but is also seen to count.” “As leaders, we must be mindful of this, for any system built on anything less will not endure.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
