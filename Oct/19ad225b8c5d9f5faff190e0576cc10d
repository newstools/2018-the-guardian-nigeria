Has Kanye West’s “eyes seen the glory? Ye who has made several controversial political statements that has won and made him loose fans and friends has decided to “distance” himself from politics. For a minute, he acted oblivious of the counter-attack from people ranging from his views on slavery to his acquaintances with POTUS Donald Trump and more recently, his new logo promoting his views. The logo apparently did not go down with him as he tweeted that he has nothing to do with it. I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine. I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it. — ye (@kanyewest) October 30, 2018  In a rather unusual twist, he tweeted minutes ago stating that “his eyes are now wide open.” My eyes are now wide open and now realize I’ve been used to spread messages I don’t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!! — ye (@kanyewest) October 30, 2018  Back to doing what you know best Ye!
