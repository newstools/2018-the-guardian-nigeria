Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Reverend Father Matthew Hassan Kukah, who spoke in company of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and General Overseer of Foursquare Gospel Church, Reverend Felix Meduoye, made the call yesterday in Lagos. He called on Nigerians to look at the antecedents of politicians who want to be president or governors next year and judge them by their track records. Speaking on The Trying Triangle Of Economy, Faith And Politics: Looking Through The Eye Of The Needle, organised by Foursquare Gospel Church to mark its 63rd yearly convention scheduled for November, Kukah said politicians pretend to be religious and as such, Nigerians should ask them what they have done in the past and what they intend to achieve if elected into office. “There is a saying almost everywhere in the world that as a politician you have to pretend to be religious.  And I use the word pretending to be religious because it is actually a strategy for mobilisation. “And I call on our people to be more discerning and judge people by their past in terms of their tract records because you can tell of a man’s ability based on what he had done and how he was able to do it.” Obasanjo, who chaired the event, commended the church for coming up with the theme at a time like this, saying a good politician must have good knowledge of the economy, faith and politics for him to govern well, otherwise he will fail woefully.
