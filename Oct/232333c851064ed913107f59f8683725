Senator Ademola Adeleke The Nigerian government has filed a four-count charge against the senator representing  Osun West senatorial district Ademola Adeleke and four others. Adeleke, his brother Sikiru Adeleke, the principal of Ojo-Aro Community Grammar School Aregbesola Muftau, the registrar of the school Gbadamosi Ojo, and a teacher in the school, Dare Olutope are to appear before the Federal High Court in Abuja for alleged examination malpractice. The two Adelekes were accused by the Nigerian police, of fraudulently registering as students of Ojo-Aro Community Grammar School, Ojo-Aro, Osun State, to enable them sit for the National Examination Council (NECO) examination of June/July 2017. The four defendants were present in court on Monday but the senator was absent. The judge, I.E Ekwo, during a brief hearing, directed the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to ensure all the five defendants were brought to court for arraignment on October 31. The senator stated that the charges against him are a witch hunt to stop him from demanding a tribunal. Adeleke was defeated by Adegboyega Oyetola, the All Progressives Congress’ candidate in the  Osun State governorship election  in September. The former opposition People’s Democratic Party governorship candidate had filed a petition before the election petition tribunal challenging the cumulative results of the September 22 election and the September 27 re-run declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
