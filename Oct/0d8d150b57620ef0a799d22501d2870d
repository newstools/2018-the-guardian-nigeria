   In his statement of claim, he averred that he did not appoint either directly or an agent to sell the said land to WAEC International, hence, there was no sale or transfer of possession of the disputed land to the 2nd defendant.He added that as far back as 1985, he obtained by purchase, four plots of land measuring 3233.643 square metres from Maxi Market Limited through the company’s Managing Director Olusola Omoniran (now deceased).
 
He also claimed that the 1st and 2nd defendants had, without his consent and against his interest, wrongfully, illegally and unlawfully, entered, occupied and are on his plots of land, and have commenced preparation for buildings and construction works on the disputed land.However, the 1st and 2nd defendants in their counter affidavit dated November 2, 2011, stated that the lands in dispute had been the subject matter in suit ID/171/2006, and that judgment was entered on February, 2009, pursuant to the terms of settlement dated November 27, 2008, between the claimant and Maxi Market Limited (1st defendant).
 
The 1st defendant specifically added that it appointed its agent, Dr. Olulana, to negotiate with the claimant on the value of the said land and that after serious negotiation, the parties allegedly agreed to the conclusive payment of the sum of N25 million, which was paid to the claimant as the final settlement of his claim of land.   The defendants added that the institution of the suit by the claimant after he had collected N25 million was an afterthought.
