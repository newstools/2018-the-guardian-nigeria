The court order came a year after a popular Nigerian musician Charly Boy filed an N500 million lawsuit against the Federal Capital Territory Police Command and the commissioner of police for FCT for allegedly harassing him and other protesters. The protest tagged #ResumeOrResign was held under the auspices of “Our-Mumu-Don-Do Movement” on August 9, 2017, as parts of the Movement’s campaign against President Muhammadu Buhari prolonged stay in London on medical vacation. The protesters accused Buhari of holding the country to ransom by his continued absence, while the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was unable to allocate portfolios to ministerial nominees and take decisions that could move the nation forward despite the transmission of power to him. Charly Boy, who led the protest, alleged that the men of the Nigerian police harassed him and members of the movement and the Concerned Nigerian group during the protest. But the FCT Police Command said it intervened to prevent breakdown of law and order, and disturbance of public peace by dispersing miscreants, hoodlums and other criminal elements that had infiltrated the protest by the group.
