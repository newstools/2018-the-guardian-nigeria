US Rapper 50 Cent real name Curtis Jackson seems to be on a trolling spree as he yet again picks on another star. This time it is Jarule’s turn to be dished a dose of his “shades” as he buys 200 tickets of front row seats for a Jarule’s show just so as to keep it empty. The Power star posted a doctored image of himself sitting alone amid empty seats on his Instagram page with a comment ‘I just bought 200 seats in the front so they can be empty. LOL.’ He seems to be having a time of his life this year as he trolls one person after another. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-774480 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889.jpg" alt="" width="765" height="1280" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889.jpg 1064w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889-357x598.jpg 357w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889-688x1152.jpg 688w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889-333x557.jpg 333w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889-666x1114.jpg 666w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889-143x240.jpg 143w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889-287x480.jpg 287w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_20181028-005839_Instagram-e1540684962889-358x600.jpg 358w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /> The feud between the two rappers has been going on since the 2000s but was reignited this year. It is not clear what caused the feud in the first place but it doesn’t seem to have an end. A few days ago he had thrown shades at Ashanti because her show had made a handful of sales.
