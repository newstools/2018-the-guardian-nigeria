Many social media users all over the world panicked earlier today when the world’s largest photo-sharing site, Instagram went down for about an hour.  The site and its app crashed for over an hour. Instagram verification. Photo: TechCrunch The site and its app crashed just days after both of Instagram’s founders resigned from Facebook and barely a day after a new boss was appointed to the company. It is gathered that reports of the crash started just after 5pm AEST from Australia, Japan, India, America, the UK, and Europe, with the company’s website displaying nothing but a “5xx Server Error” message. The app, on the other hand, told users, “We’re sorry, but something went wrong”.
