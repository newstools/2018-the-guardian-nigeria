Is this the end? Diddy and Cassie Ventura have reportedly broken up after over 10 years of being together. This break up happened months ago and is as a result of Cassie’s refusal to continue to be with him if he continues to be involved with other women. It is no news that Diddy has been in a rocky relationship with Cassie Ventura and they have been going on and off for several reasons including his flings. There was also a time that the police had to be called in to separate a fight. According to LoveBScott, Diddy has started seeing another lady, 26-year-old model Jocelyn Chew. The two have been spotted on a vacation at Miami and have been attending concerts together. Meanwhile, Cassie has been unusually quiet about her relationship and has since unfollowed his accounts. Recall that he said in 2015 that he wasn’t thinking of marriage on  Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live.” See some of Chew’s pictures below:   I’ll teach you how to make popcorn!
