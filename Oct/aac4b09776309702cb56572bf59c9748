 The President of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba PHOTO: NAN  The NLC, in conjunction with the Nigeria Union of Mine Workers (NUMW) accused the companies of maltreating their Nigerian employees, contrary to the country’s labour law. The affected companies are A and B, Multi Verse and Abstar, located in Obafemi Owode Local Council Area of the state. They were led by the state NLC Chairman, Comrade Akeem Ambali, who also accused the companies of underpaying their workers below the existing N18, 000 minimum wage. Other allegations were that, most of the employees are casual workers who operate under “poor and unfriendly environment.” Also included is the firm’s refusal for the employees to join a union to articulate their welfare. The action began at 11:00 a.m., with the protesters carrying placards with various inscriptions as: “Enough of despotic business ideology by the Chinese,”  “Who owns the land?” We Africans.” Ambali told The Guardian that the protest was aimed at curbing anti-workers’ interest against Nigerian employees. He said: “We are here to defend the interest of the workers and we are closing down the companies over anti-workers actions against them by their Chinese employers. “The workers are not being paid the minimum wage, and even the Chinese firms have refused to allowed them to unionise, because they know that they would definitely fight for their rights.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
