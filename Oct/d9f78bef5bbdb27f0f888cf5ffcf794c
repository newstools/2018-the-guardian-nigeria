Kwara State Police Command has said that bad elements, including political thugs, in the state would be cleared from the streets before next year’s general elections. The commissioner of police, Fafowora Bolaji, told reporters in Ilorin, that the measure would ensure a peaceful exercise. According to him, officers and men of the command would sweep the streets of Ilorin and environs of political thugs and cultists “who are already warming up” to be used by some politicians before, during and after the elections. He reiterated that “policing has nothing to do with politics,” but to protect the lives and property of law-abiding citizens.The police boss explained that his posting to Kwara had no political colouration. Fafowora, who cautioned politicians against violating the electoral law, said that he would soon hold a meeting with all the registered political parties and their leaders to teach them to play the game of politics according to the rules. Describing the state as relatively peaceful compared with some states of the federation, he said that the command would not take the peace for granted, as it is always at peace times that security is taken more seriously. According to him, drug infiltration into Kwara from neighbouring states could be curbed by effective policing, adding that he had already met with other security operatives to ensure better policing of the boarder areas.The police boss admonished his officers and men to abide strictly by the force orders and the Force Administrative  Instructions in the discharge of their duties, and that any one found wanting would be severely dealt with in accordance with the law.
