Pharrell Williams has become the latest artiste to tell Donald Trump not to play his song at a Trump event. This is coming after his song Happy was played alongside Girls Just Want To Have Fun by Cyndi Lauper while student farmers were waiting for Trump to address the shooting incident in Pittsburgh that left 11 Jews dead. Williams has said in a statement that Trump cease-and-desist from playing his song or face legal action. “On the day of the mass murder of 11 human beings at the hands of a deranged ‘nationalist,’ you played his song ‘Happy’ to a crowd at a political event in Indiana.” “There was nothing ‘happy’ about the tragedy inflicted upon our country on Saturday and no permission was granted for your use of this song for this purpose.” “Pharrell has not, and will not, grant you permission to publicly perform or otherwise broadcast or disseminate any of his music,” the letter stated. Other artistes who have done told Trump to desist include The Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Queen, Adele, Elton John and Aerosmith.
