The real thing or not, it seems that Wizkid and Tiwa Savage may have confirmed their relationship in the recently released video Fever. While some Nigerians are unbothered by the video which seemed a little too romantic, Teebillz, a lot more Nigerians are more concerned about Teebillz. Teebillz had, in September, put an end to the relationship rumours between the two when he stated on his Instagram in a later deleted post, “Whether you like it or not Ayo is my little brother and he knows not to cross me on blood Gang… My Big Homie Sauce kid aka Sinzu guaranteed me on that even though he’s my blood. Don Jazzy will never allow that!” He went on, “But 4real on Jamil#!!!!! Tiwa will never disrespect me like That!!! F**K your opinion on them!!!! @tiwasavage@wizkidayo keep giving us that.” Tiwa had also said in an interview that she has “grown a thick skin, so certain rumours or insinuations don’t get to me again.” After the steamy video with captivating visuals where Tiwa Savage plays a video vixen, Teebillz may have to swallow his words because Nigerians have armed themselves to ask him questions like the average Nigerian parent:        This might as well be a PR stunt:   Either this is a rumour or they will “keep giving us that”, you know.
