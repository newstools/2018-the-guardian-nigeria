 [FIL EPHOTO] Mobile Phone  Samsung is next with 7.6 per cent and Huawei with three per cent.
  
The research firm said over the forecast period, Smartphone is expected to record strong volume growth due to the desire for more technologically advanced mobile phones by the young adult population including the Z generation.
  
According to Euromonitor, smartphone grew by 10 per cent in retail volume terms in 2018 to reach six million, while feature phones records five per cent retail volume growth in 2018 to reach 12 million units.  
  
The mobile ecosystem is expected to be charged up competitively following the influx of Chines manufactures and domestic players such as Zinox Technologies and AfriOne, among others. These companies are expected to lead strong price competition, with the Chinese firms offering cheaper smartphones for different segments of the population, particularly low end and middle income consumers.  It however, said Apple increased volume share in 2018 due to launch of the iPhone X late in 2017.
  
According to the market research firm, although domestic manufacturers are only present in the mobile phones, international players still dominate with a near monopoly presence, but that nevertheless, companies such as AfriOne, which launched the first locally made smartphone in April 2017, have scope to succeed.
   
Challenges to success include the high production cost in Nigeria caused by lack of adequate infrastructure, but with future improvement, especially in the power sector could compete favourably with international players and produce more affordable brands to meet the needs of low-income consumers.
