The General Overseer of Revival Assembly Church, Apostle Anselm Madubuko, and his Kenyan wife, Emmy Kosgie, recently celebrated their fifth year wedding anniversary in style. The man of God took out time to appreciate his woman, who has shown him the most tremendous support a woman could give a man and has also helped to ensure that the church of God moves forward. The two lovebirds tied the knot five years ago in Kenya, before returning to Nigeria to hold their wedding thanksgiving at the Revival Assembly in Ogba, Lagos, with the grand reception later in the day at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers, Ikeja, Lagos. Madubuko lost his wife, Pastor Connie, in 2008 to heart attack at a private hospital in Lagos, after turning 50, while husband was away in America for evangelism.
