 NLC<br />  The state Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Mr Bashir Mafara, made this known while briefing newsmen in Gusau. “Our stand remains the same with that of the national body. “We do not receive directives from governors so the governors’ resolution has nothing to do with our position,” he said. Marafa lamented that some workers in the state, were yet to benefit from the N18, 000 minimum wage, in spite of the fact that the state governor is the Chairman of the Governors’ Forum. He said workers in the state were ever ready for the industrial action as planned by the organised labour. Marafa said workers in the state would continue to support labour leaders in any way to succeed in their struggle for better welfare.
