People generally tend to look at life from their experiences and perceptions that is why one event will be explained differently from different individuals. So, how does a person maintain a relationship when we are all looking at the same issue but seeing different realities? How does one respond appropriately to a situation when we are all hearing but not listening?  This coloured reality is the basis of this dilemma: her story vs his story vs the truth. Often time, this scenario plays out especially when conflict arises between partners. When the man and woman explain to a third party sometimes it does not add up not because they are lying but their experiences have coloured the entire story. So, do we believe him or her? What is the true story?
