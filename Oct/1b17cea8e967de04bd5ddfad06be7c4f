Shehu Sani The presidency has distanced President Muhammadu Buhari from a letter currently in circulation alleging that he had authorised a governor or anyone else to “deal with traitors and disloyal members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), especially Senator Shehu Sani.” In a statement, the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, said: “We wish to confirm that the president is not aware of any of such letter, let alone authorising anyone to deal with any party member. “Given President Buhari’s record, it is inconceivable that he would usurp the role of party leaders and instruct anyone to punish a party member. “In the light of above, we would like to appeal to the public, especially members of the press, to ignore false or unauthorised information intended to attribute to the president any action which is not in line with his character.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
