Federal Government’s youth empowerment scheme, N-power, Wednesday, named some beneficiaries of the programme that have been expelled from the scheme. The scheme disclosed that the affected beneficiaries were kicked out because they were civil servants who had flouted its prior warning that intending beneficiaries, who are gainfully employed, should not apply for the programme. “The following beneficiaries have been exited from the N-Power programme because they have existing jobs,”N-power said on Twitter. The expelled beneficiaries who are civil servants in Ebonyi State include: Itumo Sunday, a Civil Servant at Ebonyi ADP, Mba Cletus Nwosike a Civil Servant at Judiciary High Court, Ogala Onyekachi Onwe – Civil Servant at CEB CSS Ekwashi, Ogbaga Simon Nwalegu Civil Servant Ministry of Water. N-power is a volunteer corps initiative under the Federal Government’s Social Investment Programmes, SIP, that has recruited 500,000 graduates so far. It is currently in operation in the 36 states of Nigeria. The main thrust of the N-Power scheme is to harness Nigeria’s young demography through appropriate skill development, providing a structure for large scale and relevant work skills acquisition and development, and linking outcomes to fixing inadequate public services and stimulating the larger economy. Beneficiaries are engaged on different areas of public service, including education (N-Teach), health (N-Health), agriculture (N-Agro), building/construction (N-Build). Beneficiaries are paid a monthly stipend of N30,000 during their period of engagement. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
