In 2015, a curator Jamillah James organised her first solo exhibition at the Hammer Museum. James went on to organise another exhibition in Los Angeles earning Akunyili, her recognition. The New Yorker describes her works as “layered in her works by collage and acetone-transfer prints, creating a fabric of images throughout her paintings”. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-753848 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Njideka-Akunyili-Crosby.-Photo-W-Magazine-e1538403521261.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> In 2016, Financial Times named Akunyili Crosby Woman of the Year.” That same year, the “Victoria Miro” art gallery gained interest in her works and started representing her.
