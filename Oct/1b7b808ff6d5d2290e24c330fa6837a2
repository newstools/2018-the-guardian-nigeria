We can agree that no other club shows the Nigerian Super Eagles team, the love that Italian club, AS Roma does. The club via their social media handle has consistently shown allegiance to the Super Eagles team right from their time at the 2018 World Cup until now. Not only was the Super Eagles Nigerian jersey voted the Best Nike Home Kit at the 2018 World Cup by AS Roma fans. They have also shown that they are more Nigerian than some of the Nigerian sports social media. While we know that Nigerian OAP Mark “Dsoulja” Otabor is signed to RomaTV (Roma football fan TV), some Nigerians suggest that their social media account might also be handled a Nigerian who some say is Chinedu and others, Obinna and yet some, Mark himself. What you are about to see is the Champions League commentary video that shot Mark into the limelight:  Here are some of their epic moments with Nigerians: When they superimposed their logo on the Super Eagles tricycle (Keke)  When they unveiled their Super Eagles influenced jersey:  When they jumped on the Nigerian slang, #Importanter  When Nigeria won Libya at the #AFCON Qualifiers  Solidarity forever!!!
