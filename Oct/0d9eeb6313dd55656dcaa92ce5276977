The Federal Ministry of Transportation says it will cancel the scheduled hosting of the 2018 National Council for Transportation (NCT) conference by Bayelsa if the state was not prepared for it. The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, disclosed this in Abuja on Friday. Amaechi said that the council meeting was meant to hold early this year as resolved at the 15th edition of the NCT which held in Sokoto in 2017. “We are battling with the state; the ministry is ready for the event and we have told them that since the last edition was held in the north, this year’s edition is to be held in the South. “We are just waiting for Bayelsa State to ask us to come for the event, but if Bayelsa is not ready, we will pull out to another state that is ready to host it, ”Amaechi said. The annual conference is a policy making one in which transport stakeholders deliberate on issues that will move the sector forward and also monitor the implementation of previous policies.
