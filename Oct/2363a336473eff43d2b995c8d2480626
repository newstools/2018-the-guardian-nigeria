While Akinlaja, who is the chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream), defected to the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Temitope moved to the Action Democratic Party (ADP). Temitope’s defection may not be unconnected to his inability to win Oyo Central senatorial district primaries. He had intended to contest the governorship primaries before opting for the senatorial seat. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
