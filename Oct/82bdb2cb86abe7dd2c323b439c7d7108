Nigerian songstress, Omawumi has thrown a major jab at two major 2019 presidential aspirants during a recent live performance. The award-winning singer who refrained from mentioning specific names in her public call out described one of them an incompetent old man and the other as someone that is ‘somewhat corrupt. She said, ”They are asking you to vote the two major parties that are representing an incompetent old man and somebody that is somewhat corrupt. It is painful. It starts with you and me. Let’s do the right thing in our hearts and gradually we would overcome this rubbish. Our systems would start working. Education would start working. Health would start working. Nigeria can be great.” The “Play Na Play” crooner will not be the first Nigerian celebrity to call out politicians ahead of the 2019 election. It will be recalled that during a performance, Small Doctor appeared to have thrown shades at President Muhammadu Buhari although his management explained that he meant no disrespect and that he wasn’t trying to be political.
