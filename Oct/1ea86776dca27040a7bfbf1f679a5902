Cardi B made herself available to the New York police today, the NBC Channel 4 News reports. This is in line with her role in the strip club fight that happened in August. At the fight, she allegedly ordered an attack with bottles and chairs on two bartenders and sisters, Jade and Baddie Gi for sleeping with her husband, Offset. The sisters were injured but refused medical treatment promising to sue her. According to several reports, she turned herself in before 10 am. Cardi B will be chaged with reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct. “Whether she’s a famous rapper or a common street hood, she’s got to be held accountable for her criminal actions. It’s as simple as that: She ordered the beating after threatening my clients and later participated in an assault against them.” Joseph Tacopino, the girls’ lawyers said.
