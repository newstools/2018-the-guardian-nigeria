He said as the country gradually move towards next year’s general elections, all hands must be on deck to protect democracy in Nigeria. While expressing his condolences to the family of the slain Adara chief, Dr. Maiwada Galadima, by his kidnappers, as well as the government and people in the state, Makarfi said: “It is unfortunate that while efforts to return the state to normalcy, following the violence that occurred at Kasuwan Magani were on, we woke up to hear that the traditional ruler of Adara Chiefdom was killed and his body deposited around Kateri, along Abuja-Kaduna Highway, after his abductors had collected a ransom from the community. “The action by the criminals is despicable and should be condemned by all peace-loving people of the state and Nigerians in general. All hands must be on deck to ensure that our nascent democracy is not derailed in the country through emerging scenario of conflicts and violence.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
