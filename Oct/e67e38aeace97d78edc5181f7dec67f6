Cardi B has certified that she is a rapper to be taken seriously since the release of her debut album, “Invasion of Privacy”. Although many speculated that the mother of one will be a one-hit wonder, she has gone on to churn out three number one hit songs, a feat no other female rapper has ever achieved. The multiple awards winning female rapping sensation is however not resting as she has continued her dominating spree by going on to have several noteworthy collaborations. She made her solo return to music when she announced that her new single, “Money” was set for release last week Thursday but due to a leak, the song was made available to fans two days earlier than scheduled. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-771644 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1185" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram.jpg 1200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-606x598.jpg 606w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-1167x1152.jpg 1167w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-487x481.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-974x962.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-243x240.jpg 243w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-486x480.jpg 486w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cardi-B-Money-Instagram-600x593.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /> “Money” is already a hit as it now dominates several chats and Cardi B is so excited about her latest success that she couldn’t help but brag about it on her social media.
