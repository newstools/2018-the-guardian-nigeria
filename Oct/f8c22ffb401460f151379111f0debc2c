A group, Rural Educational Improvement and Development, has promised to partner the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to tackle vote buying and electoral violence. The group stated this yesterday when its members visited the INEC office in Jalingo, the Taraba State capital.According to its Chief Executive, Bello A. Bako, it “has become relevant for the organisation to seek partnership with INEC to educate the electorate on the dangers of vote buying, electoral violence, hate speech and fake news.”He stressed that the move was important to “save our nascent democracy from collapsing.” The group urged governments at all levels to adopt measures that would checkmate the menace from “destroying our society and democracy.”Citing Article 130 A-B of the Electoral Act 2010, the group advocated stiffer penalties against politicians who perpetuate the act.He tasked stakeholders and key principal actors to campaign against the ills. The state’s INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Baba Abba Yusuf, commended the group, adding that the move was necessary for the growth of democracy in the country.Yusuf said INEC would not hesitate to partner any organisation that has the interest of the commission and the country at heart.“Stopping vote buying is not the responsibility of INEC, as the commission lacks the power to arrest and prosecute,” he said.He however expressed the commission’s readiness to provide a level playing-ground for all candidates, irrespective of political party affiliations.
