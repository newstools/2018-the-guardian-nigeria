Osun Election Petition Tribunal, sitting in Osogbo yesterday granted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)â€™s request for substituted service to the defendants. The PDP and its candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke had sought an exparte application to serve the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. The panel also granted an application to enable the PDP take possession of the Certified True Copies (CTCs) of all the materials used for the conduct of the September 22 and September 27 governorship elections in the state. PDP filed its petition at the tribunal last Tuesday and had served the first respondent, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), but Oyetola and APC allegedly declined to be served. Justice Peter Obiora, who delivered the ruling on behalf of the tribunal chairman, Justice Muhammad Siraju, said the court was satisfied with the report of services and there was merit in the application. Obiora said the essence of granting the applications was to bring proceedings to the attention and notices of the respondents in the substantial suit before the tribunal. He said the tribunal would do justice in its proceedings without any form of bias and intimidation, as long as they stay in Osogbo. A 12-paragraph affidavit and written addresses, in support of the affidavit were attached to the application that was brought by counsel to the applicant, Mr. Nathaniel Oke (SAN). The court, in granting the two applications, placed a caveat that two persons must serve as observers when the PDP is taking possession of the materials.
