When it comes to certain issues concerning Family, some people will play the “a wife should always support her husband” card. But First Lady, Aisha is not having that, as she has vocally castigated her husband’s party on their activities. She stated via her Twitter account that, “It is disheartening to note that some aspirants used their hard earned money to purchase nomination forms, got screened, cleared and campaigned vigorously yet found their names omitted on election day. These forms were bought at exorbitant prices.”  This is not the first time she would voice her opinion in what seems to be lack of support for her husband’s political party. Some Nigerians are reacting via twitter to this new development.
