The Nigerian Police has refuted the rumors that the Guaranty Trust Bank on Bode Thomas, Lagos, was robbed. The Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Yomi Shogunle, while denying the robbery said unidentified men on a motorcycle shot a man standing in front of the bank on the leg and sped off. “GT Bank Bode Thomas Branch Lagos is NOT UNDER ATTACK,” Shogunle tweeted. “Men on motorcycle shot a man standing in front of the bank on the leg & sped off.” This is coming after a twitter handler, The Nneka, tweeted that the bank was under a robbery attack. “Armed robbers are in GTB Bode Thomas branch,” The Nneka tweeted. The Nneka further noted that the alleged robbers asked for the victim’s “money first at the ATM gallery but he resisted and got shot in the leg.” Shogunle, however, noted that policemen are at the scene to restore normalcy while the victim has been rushed to hospital and he is in stable condition.
