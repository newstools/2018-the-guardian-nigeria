Asks party to market Buhari projects
Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is not a pushover and therefore should not be taken for granted by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general elections. Bello also warned that if the ruling APC must remain in power after 2019, it must go all out to aggressively market President Muhammadu Buhari to Nigerians citing the projects embarked upon by his administration since he took over in 2015. The Kogi State governor spoke on Wednesday night at a dinner organised by the President for his youth political appointees held at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.He said the issue of perception should be taken seriously by the APC to forestall any chance for the PDP to stage a return to power. An Executive Director at the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), Jasper Azuatalam, who also spoke at the event, told the President that most Nigerians were presently disappointed with him because he has failed to perform the magic they expected from him. Meanwhile, the President while thanking the group, re-assured the youths that Nigeria has all it takes for them to live a good life.
Buhari, who condemned the rush by some Nigerians, especially the youths, in search of greener pastures abroad, said his administration was determined to transform the country and make it better than it met it. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
