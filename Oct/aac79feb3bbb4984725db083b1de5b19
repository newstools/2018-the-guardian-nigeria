The world of art was thrown into confusion and shock when a painting worth 1.04m British pounds shredded itself after being auctioned at Sotheby’s. The Banksy painting, which was a framed Girl with Balloon was said to be the artist’s best work, was the last painting to be auctioned at the prestigious auctioning house. Just moments after the final call and the hammer was pounded, the canvas was shredded. “It appears we just got Banksy-ed,” said Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s senior director and head of contemporary art in Europe. There is still a lot of unanswered questions. People are wondering what will happen to the buyer of the painting and if Sotheby’s was aware of the stunt that was pulled by the artist. Banksy is an anonymous artist who is believed to be British residing in Bristol, who uses a distinct stencilling style to depict his works on streets, walls and bridges of cities all over the world. He does not sell his work but auctioneers have attempted to sell his work at the spot which it was created. Banksy posted the incident on Instagram.
