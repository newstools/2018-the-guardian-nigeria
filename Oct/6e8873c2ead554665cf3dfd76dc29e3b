Ciara, the hip-hop star,  recreated Nakia’s look from the movie- Black panther. The 33-year-old singer definitely inspired us with her Nakia’s look just like Beyonce who recreated Toni Braxton’s look for Halloween. Before the Halloween party, Ciara took to Instagram to share a video showing off her Halloween costume.   Wakanda Forever. #BlackPanther.
