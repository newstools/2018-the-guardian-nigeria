The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe,  has dismissed insinuation that he will leave the party due to controversy surrounding the governorship primaries. Abe, who represents Rivers South East senatorial district and emerged as the governorship candidate in a parallel primaries organised by the Peter Odike-led factional state executive, said he was not ready to leave a house he helped to build for strangers. He said: “How can I leave my fathers house and deny my inheritance? We built the house with our tears, sweat, and blood. We will stay in our father’s house and fight for justice. No stranger can chase me out of my home. Desperation leads to fake news. Ignore them and focus on God of justice. Hold your peace and be still, for the God of justice will speak and every other voice shall be silent.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
