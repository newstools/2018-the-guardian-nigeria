Governor Rochas Okorocha Members of Governor Rochas Okorocha’s faction the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday obstructed human and vehicular movement on major streets of Owerri, Imo State, protesting the rejection of their list of candidates by the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). The protesters, largely youths, disrupted economic and social activities in the capital city of the Eastern Heartland wielding placards with various inscriptions. They urged the APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to allow the list sent to the headquarters of the party to be the one to be forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for next year’s general elections. According to the protesters, names of those who either lost or did not contest the primaries were added to the list by the NWC in the name of harmonisation to accommodate those in the opposing camp known as Coalition. The fate of Okorocha’s son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, is hanging, as his case with Senator Hope Uzodinma in an Abuja court has not been decided. Another case sparking the protest is the alleged substitution of the name of the immediate past Commissioner for Information, Prof. Nnamdi Obiaraeri, with that of incumbent Senator Benjamin Uwajimogu (Imo North), who has reportedly been given automatic ticket. Okorocha’s embattled deputy, Eze Madumere, and Uzodinma are staunch members of the Coalition. The Guardian gathered that Ahmed Gulak, who conducted the first primary election in Imo APC, announced Uzodinma as the winner. But Oshiomhole quickly cancelled it and dispatched another committee led by Brig-Gen. Agbakabia, (rtd.) who declared Nwosu and largely Okorocha’s loyalists as the winners. The protesters vowed not to renege until the names of members in their faction were restored. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
