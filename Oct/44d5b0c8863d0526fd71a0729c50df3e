Gravina, previously one of three candidates in an unsuccessful January election, stood down from his Lega Pro post last week in preparation for his renewed bid to become the FIGC chief.

Italy’s Olympic Committee appointed Roberto Fabbricini as FIGC commissioner in February after an election failed to produce a new president.
