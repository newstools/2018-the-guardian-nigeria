 Plateau  The Guardian also learnt that tension pervaded the streets of Jos during the delegates’ congress of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. During its primaries, APC’s 3,150 delegates were to endorse incumbent governor, Simon Bako Lalong, who is the party’s sole candidate, while PDP’s 2,100 delegates would elect a candidate from among 13 governorship aspirants. Former Deputy Senate President, Ibrahim Nasiru Mantu, was appointed to head a committee to reduce the number of governorship aspirants to a manageable size, but the committee noted that the election might last till 10.00pm yesterday. However, there were sporadic gunshots across Jos metropolis, especially in Rikkos, Bauchi Ring Road, Students’ Village, University of Jos, Dilimi and Cele Bridge near Tina Junction in Jos North Council. It was also learnt that two persons were killed during a communal clash between Hausa youth and some natives at a river where they go to wash. Before the matter could escalate, troops of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) arrived on time to douse tension, while soldiers took charge of the area. Some visitors who were on transit from a wedding ceremony in Gombe who missed their way were attacked and three of them killed. Spokesmen of the OPSH and the state police command declined comments on the development, but Commander of OPSH, Major-General Augustine Agundu, who made a live broadcast on the Plateau Radio Television Commission (PRTV), condemned the attacks, urging the politicians to warn their wards and supporters to eschew violence. Commissioner of Police, Undie Adie, said persons in the affected areas are advised to remain indoors, as those found loitering around aimlessly would be arrested and prosecuted.
