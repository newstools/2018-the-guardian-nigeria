 Heritage Bank  Sekibo said: “I am particularly impressed by what I have seen and what touched me most is the diversity in your areas of competence. But the intriguing part is that many of you are not actually doing what you studied in the university.
 
“For the fact that most of you are doing something different from what you study gives me hope for this country. It gives me hope to the extent that it shows it is not about what you study but about your passion. Your desire to succeed gives me hope for this country.
 
“One of the reasons why we chose, as an organization, to support “The Next Titan” is to see young men and women venture away from their seeming comfort zone, after  five years of a particular study at the university. You abandon what you study and check what humanity needs and try to cover that gap for humanity by being the best in that field.
 
“In succeeding, one needs to be daring, like some of us have dared in the past. One of the things I want to advise is not just getting to the Next Titan show, it is about what you can achieve, because there are huge opportunities and potential in each of the contestants.
 
“If you know the history of this bank, then you will understand where I am coming from. We bought a bank that was dead for 10 years. I can tell you that no bank anywhere in the world dies for 10 years and comes back alive. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
