Senator Shehu Sani Shehu Sani, the senator representing Kaduna Central, has resigned his membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Sani took the decision following the controversies which trailed the party’s primaries for the 2019 elections. His decision comes few days after the national body of the APC submitted the name of Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s political adviser, Uba Sani, as the candidate to replace Sani’s senatorial district. There is a deep-rooted animosity between the Kaduna State governor and Sani which can be dated to 2015 after their inauguration. In August, Sani alongside Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi was accused of working against the progress of the party and the state in connivance. The duo was consequently suspended by the Kaduna state chapter on the APC. While Hunkuyi dumped the party to the People’s Democratic Party, Sani remained in APC. The decision by the APC to clear Sani as its only candidate to contest the Kaduna Central senatorial seat in 2019 may not be unconnected to an alleged deal reached to prevent him from dumping the ruling party at a time when it was hit by a gale of defection. The decision was not well received by the governor who did not see the senator as an ally. The Kaduna APC on Saturday conducted primaries for the senatorial ticket. That election was won by Uba Sani, an aide to El-Rufai. Until now, the national body of the party is yet to react to the election.
