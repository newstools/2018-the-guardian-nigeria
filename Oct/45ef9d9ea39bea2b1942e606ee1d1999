The lawsuit says Facebook did not do enough to verify the user’s identity, and that Jane Doe was never warned that sex traffickers were operating on the social media network. She also named as defendants the now shuttered classified ads website Backpage.com and its founders. Her suit says she was “friended” on Facebook in 2012 by a user who appeared to know several of her real-life friends, and that he messaged her through Facebook. She claimed that one point following an argument with her mother, the trafficker offered to console her, but instead beat, raped and took pictures of her that were posted on Backpage.com.
