Sixteen days after the Nigerian Senate resumed from its annual recess that lasted for 10 weeks, the Upper Chamber Wednesday adjourned its plenary for two weeks. Senate President, Bukola Saraki, who announced the adjournment said the senators will resume for plenary on November 6. He noted that the two weeks recess would enable relevant committees to carry out oversight functions. “These are committees that are going to carry out the oversight. It is only plenary session that is being suspended. We expect our committees to carry out oversight in this period,” Saraki said. “The committees will still be meeting till Tuesday, November 6, because the recess is only for plenary session.” The Senate committees working on the implementation of the 2018 budget and the recently approved Eurobond loan are expected “to carry out the necessary oversight” so that they can report when plenary resumes.
