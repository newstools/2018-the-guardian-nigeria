Aspirants who failed to win the All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries in Akwa Ibom State have pledged support for the party’s chosen candidates at the state and national levels. They made the resolution at the campaign grounds of its governorship candidate, Mr. Nsima Ekere in Uyo, after reconciliation by the party’s leadership. A former House of Assembly aspirant in Uyo state constituency, Mr. Aniekan Udosen moved the motion at the weekend. His counterpart in Okobo state constituency, Emmanuel Isangedoho, seconded the motion, which was put to vote by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate) Matters, Senator Ita Enang.
Ekere assured them of accommodation in the incoming APC administration in the state. He said: “Nobody will be left out. We will ensure that all of you would be part of the next government in 2019. Your contributions to the making of the next government would not be forgotten.” He advised the aspirants to realize that, by not getting the party’s tickets, God had something else in store for them, while commending them for calling meetings to turn in their supporters to the party’s candidates. He promised that his campaign organisation would be expanded to integrate them to continue their grassroots’ mobilisation for the party.
 Ekere, who is the Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), said victory for the APC in the state was certain because “God has changed the story of APC in Akwa Ibom.” Bishop Ekpe James and Arc. Otu Ita-Toyo, who vied for senatorial seats, as well as other House of Assembly aspirants, Udosen, Isangedoho and Obong Koko Abia, commended Ekere for promising to accommodation them. Among others who attended the meeting were Dr. Amadu Attai, the state APC Secretary, Mr. Augustine Ekanem, and other members of the APC Executive Committee.
