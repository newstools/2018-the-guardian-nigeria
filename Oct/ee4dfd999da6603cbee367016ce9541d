Coco’s ‘Na You’ is a basic, girl-meets-boy love story, where she narrates all the things she finds attractive about her love interest. The light-hearted manner in which she delivers the lyrics makes the afro-highlife song even more enjoyable. Coco, born Catherine Chinasa Onyekwere is a budding Nigerian who draws inspiration and hopes to make music that is culturally relevant. The ‘Na You’ video, directed by Unlimited LA, gives us an excellent story that’s very easy to relate to. Coco is your typical girl-next-door, lounging around her plush room, chatting with her lover, writing in her diary, and excitedly getting ready for a day out with her friends. We see the artiste and her friends driving through the city having a good time, and follow them to a poolside where Coco eventually reconnects with her love interest. The simplicity of the story makes it easy to follow, that will draw a lot of giggles from young girls.
