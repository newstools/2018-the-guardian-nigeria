There doubting of the fact, the entertainment industry throughout Nigeria’s 58 years as a nation has been a source of pride, as some of the musical acts that have entertained us over the years include Afrobeat maestro, late Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Sir Victor Uwaifor, Ebenezer Obey, while we have the contemporary musicians and DJs such as 2face, Wizkid, Davido, Tiwa Savage, DJs Jimmy Jatt, Spinall, Cuppy. As part of activities to celebrate this year’s independence, telecommunication giant, MTN Nigeria sponsored what will term as the biggest pre-independence party on Sunday September 30. Tagged Jimmy’s Jump Off, the event, which lasted to the early hours of the D-day, October 1, had more than 20 DJs perform live to a crowd of over 1,000, spinning their decks and treated the audience to iconic, patriotic and emotional songs like King Sunny Ade’s Nigeria yi ti gbogbowa ni, Onyeka Onwenu’s One Love. Also played at the event are songs by the millennials with the new unofficial national anthem, Issa goal by Naira Marley, got the audience chanting “Naija issa goal, Independence issa goal, 58 years issa goal”. Guests at the event were rewarded with freebies such as headsets, recharge cards, phones. MTN Nigeria over the years has been a significant promoter of Nigerian music and local content, with campaigns such as the Project Fame, which has given birth to household names in the music industry such as Praiz, Chidinma, Iyanya, Niniola, and Immaculate amongst others. Also, with platforms like MTN Music+ – the largest music distributor in Africa – the telecom service provider continues to show its support for Nigerian music. In 2014 alone, the company generated over N5 billion for the music industry through the monetisation of Caller Ring Back Tunes utilising local musical content.
