A replica of the RMS Titanic (which sank in 1912) will begin its sail from Dubai in a few years from now. According to the Blue Star Line chairman, Clive Palmer, the ship which has a capacity to accommodate 2,400 passengers and 900 crew members, will be launched in 2022 as against its initial proposed launch of 2016 in China. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-768620 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1.jpg 907w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.TitanicIIExteriorA-1-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Palmer explained to Cruise Arabia & Africa that, “Blue Star Line will create an authentic Titanic experience, providing passengers with a ship that has the same interiors and cabin layout as the original vessel, while integrating modern safety procedures, navigation methods and 21st-century technology to produce the highest levels of luxurious comfort.” “After a shakedown cruise from the shipyard to Singapore, we’ll offer a two-week maiden voyage to Dubai, with another grand voyage from Dubai to Southampton,” he added. When it lands in the UK, it will begin weekly voyages to New York following the original plan of the Titanic. The Process to begin the $500m (N181,750,000,000.00 ) ship was announced in 2012.
