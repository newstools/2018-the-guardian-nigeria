 Oyigbo Market  The Guardian gathered that the deplorable state of the road led to the incident, as the Oyigbo axis of Port Harcourt/Aba Express Road has totally collapsed and could no longer accommodate heavy vehicles. Currently, the sorry state of the road in the area is forcing vehicles coming from Aba to Port Harcourt to divert to the left lane. It was at the point of diversion that the container-laden trailer somersaulted and killed the three traders. This happened barely 24 hours after a petroleum tanker loaded with Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), skidded off its lane and fell at Garrison Junction, Port Harcourt. The spilled product has continued to cause serious accidents in the area. Efforts to reach the State Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni were futile, as his phones were switched off.
