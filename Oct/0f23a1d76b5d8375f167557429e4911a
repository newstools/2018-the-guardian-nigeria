 Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike  Wike said this during a thanksgiving service at Government House, Port Harcourt yesterday, while speaking with newsmen on the success of the PDP convention, adding that he totally accepts the party’s choice as the way forward. “I supported Tambuwal fully and I have no regrets supporting him. But the party has made a choice and as a loyal party man, I stand by that choice. I will support Atiku to ensure his victory in 2019,” he said. The governor, who berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) for failing the country, charged all Nigerians to work towards sacking the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. “All hand must be on deck to ensure that this government is sacked. If the government returns in 2019, Nigerians will digging their graves.  The suffering now will be a child’s play.  That is why we must work for the good of our people,” he said. He expressed the hope that PDP will win in Rivers State in spite of the machinations of the APC Federal Government. Wike explained that his insistence that the PDP National Convention held in the state was essentially to promote and boost its economy, adding: “Rivers State has made PDP proud and we shall continue to make it proud. God lives in Rivers.” Speaking, PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, urged Nigerians to work towards taking back their country from the brink of destruction as every sector of the country has collapsed. Secondus charged the security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to work towards free and fair elections in 2019, as APC’s plot to rig the elections will be resisted. In a sermon, Apostle Zilly Aggrey said the PDP did well to thank God for the successful National Convention, noting that it was a platform for greater success.
