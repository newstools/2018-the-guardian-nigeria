 Players at the hotel, right before the press conference held at the Banquet Hall of The Ibom Hotel and Golf Resort, Uyo.  “Our players must not allow the opponent to feel comfortable on the ball,” Adegoke told The Guardian yesterday. “If that happens, our boys will need a lot of energy to chase the Libyans around. “If the Libyans are playing well, we need to know why and what we can do to distabilise them. No doubt this is a very crucial match for the Eagles, nevertheless, we need to get to the point that we should not be apprehensive of playing against any team in Africa. Based on our World Cup experience, I have not seen anything we have learnt in our team play and character development in our players. “We need more home based players to justify the reason why we have our league. We failed to produce a super star player at the World Cup, which showed that our development strategy is not working,” Adegoke stated. Speaking further, the former IICC Shooting Stars of Ibadan player said: “What I need to see in the game among other things, are good ball possession and positional play. We should allow the ball to do the running. I think Ahmed Musa has to be tutored on how to lead a team before giving him the captainship band. A captain should be able to understand what is called cognitive network on the pitch, knowing what the game demands and who can offer what at critical times.” Meanwhile, Super Eagles forward, Henry Onyekuru, says the team will go all out for a win against Libya today. Onyekuru, a former KAS Eupen and RSC Anderlecht of Belgium attacker, who joined Galatasaray on loan from Everton of England this summer, said he was happy with his scoring form in the Turkish Super Lig, and believes he can replicate that with the national team. He assures that the Super Eagles would give their best in the game.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
