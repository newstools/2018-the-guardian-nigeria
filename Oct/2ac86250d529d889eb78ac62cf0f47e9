 Shehu Sani  Sani, in a statement, yesterday, signed by his media aide, Abdulsamad Chima Amadi, said:  “The committee chairman probably had a dream to that effect. It is laughable for him to claim an aspirant who was the sole candidate cleared in Kaduna Central offered him financial inducements. “First of all, Sani virtually had no rival in the primaries, he was the only person cleared. So, what does he need to bribe the committee for? “Secondly, when the committee and the state government connived to stage a fake senatorial primaries in the state, Sani made it crystal clear that he wasn’t going to participate in the so-called primaries because it was an illegality. “So, Sani had no reasons whatsoever to bribe the committee. He is a distinguished and law abiding citizen who has over the years earned a good name for himself through his uncompromising stance against corruption. “It is obvious that some desperate politicians who have become synonymous with failure are behind all this baseless and frivolous accusations. Just like all their attempts to malign, frame up, intimidate and harm Sani in the past failed, this one too has failed on arrival. “No amount of blackmail will deter or distract Sani. We stand by the mandate given to him by the APC and good people of Kaduna Central, and as usual, that mandated shall be put to good use for the betterment of our people,” the statement stressed.
