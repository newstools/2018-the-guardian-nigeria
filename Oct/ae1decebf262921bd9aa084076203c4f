 Microsoft  Besides, the bank recently announced its five-year strategic plan focusing on enhancing Africa’s position in the global community, and descried the high-level meeting with Nadella as a step in the right direction to achieving this goal. Wigwe said: “Africa is currently experiencing a massive growth in wider access to and adoption of technology, especially in improving businesses processes and lifestyle as well as optimum use of resources. “However, we still realise that there are still untapped and   immense opportunities, to provide essential and well-secured channels for transactions using technology to raise the standard of banking services in Africa, even while understanding the socio-economic dynamics of the countries.” Responding, Nadella said: “I want Microsoft to enable organisations like Access Bank to innovate digitally, and grow their business exponentially.” He noted that only two entities are capable of being the Alibaba of Nigeria, a massive retail operation or a large financial institution. “We need partners like you, who have deep ambition for exceptional customer service. We will be delighted to form a deeper relationship with Access Bank, to drive innovation, and by extension exceptional customer experience in the African financial services space,” he added. Access Bank through this partnership with Microsoft has already begun its five-year mission to enhancing the perception of Africa by drawing the attention of global community to the  indigenous products of Africans – their rich history, people, culture, art, and lifestyle, while providing channels where businesses can fully participate in commercial activities globally.
