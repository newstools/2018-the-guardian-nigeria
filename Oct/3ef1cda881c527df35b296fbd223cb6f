A Federal High Court sitting in Jalingo, Taraba State, has summoned the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the state, Sani Abubakar Danladi, over alleged corruption. Granting application of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Justice Stephen Daniel Pam, stressed the need for Danladi, who is the third defendant to appear in court on December 5, 2018. The Guardian learnt that Dalandi and some top government officials of the state are now standing trial over offenses ranging from conspiracy to obtaining N450 million without passing through financial due process. Overwhelmed by the decision of the court to grant its application, EFCC lawyer, Ahamad Muntaka, said should Danladi or the state fail to appear in court on the stated date, the court would be left with no option than to issue a bench warrant of arrest on the defendants. Citing section 113 and 114 of the administration of criminal justice act 2015, he said Danladi, who was former Acting Governor of the state and those standing trial with him, have no legal backing to withdraw N450 million from the state treasury without passing through due process. Speaking, counsel to the third defendant, Yakubu Maikasuwa, who expressed his willingness to make all the processes available to his client, expressed optimism that Danladi would appear before the court on December 5.
