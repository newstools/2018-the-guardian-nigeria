The Musical Fela and The Kalakuta Queens is a demonstration of the rich cultural heritage that Nigeria is blessed with. The play, which tells the story of legendary musical icon and activist Fela Anikulapo Kuti, reveals the sensational life of the Queens of Kalakuta and unmasks common misconceptions about them. After an impressive show earlier in the year at the Ultra-modern Terra Kulture, the play sponsored by information and telecommunication company MTN, made its debut at the esteemed Africa Shrine on Sunday, October 14, 2018. The ICT company in the last few years has supported causes that seek to promote the Nigerian cultural heritage. A recent example is the just concluded African Drum Festival in Ogun State, which is geared towards promoting cultural orientation among Nigerians and also support talent and creativity. The story of Fela and his Kalakuta Queens is a compelling musical about the honest and selfless love the icon had with his dancers (Queens), who left their homes to follow him, believing in his vision of building a better community through arts and music; an attribute we all need to imbibe in the Nigeria of today.
