The Eko Convention Centre was transformed on 21 October as the Shuga Band hosted the Shuga coated concert. The ambience and grandeur was equal to none as guests trooped in to enjoy the evening filled with good music and each performance was a hit back to back with audience on their feet most of the time with a well-coordinated and seamless event; from the choreography, to costume, and music, the creative interpretation and precision was next to none. Some of the highlights of the event were performances by top acts Small Doctor, Mayorkun, Damola, Tosin Martins, Koffi, Funnybone, Tee A, Bolanle Olukanni, Toyin Abraham and Dayo Amusa. Among some of the top dignitaries at the event was the wife of the former Governor of Lagos State, Dame Abimbola Fashola, Dr Biodun Laja, Rtd. AIG Alapinni, Lady Maiden Ibru, Otunba Bimbo Ashiru, Hon.Bukola Olopade (Ozogula), Mrs Kemi Nelson and a host of others.
