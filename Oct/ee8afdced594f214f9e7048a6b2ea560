Aisha Buhari. PHOTO: HAYE OKOH A public commentator and member of Adamawa Elders Forum, Alhaji Suleiman Baba Jada, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to prove to Nigerians that he is not selective in his anti-corruption war by directing Economic and Financial Crimes commission (EFCC) to probe his wife Aisha Buhari how she got N2.5 billion she accused her ADC SP Baban Inna of diverting. He told journalists yesterday in Yola, the state capital that the silence of the president over the alleged N2.5b his wife said was diverted by her ADC has raised questions on the integrity of the President and his government. Jada said it is a confirmation that the anti-corruption war of the governmnt is only targeted at members of opposition parties. If the President fails to probe his wife over money which no Nigerian knows how she got it, it means that the President is shielding her. He said that without EFCC inviting Aisha Buhari for investigation, the government would no longer be taken serious on anti-corruption crusade. On the recent criticism of APC by Aisha Buhari over the just concluded All Progressive Congress (APC) primaries, the Adamawa elder faulted the First Lady, saying that she has only crossed her boundary, she has taken over government, party and the responsibilities of her husband as President.
