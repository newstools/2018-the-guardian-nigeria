With the emergence in Port Harcourt, Rivers State last Sunday of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Abuja affirmation of incumbent, President Muhammadu Buhari as the standard bearer of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) same day, it is clear that next year’s presidential contest would be a two-horse race.
   
Atiku, a veteran politician who has been throwing his hat into the rings of presidential contest since 1992 and who has built a formidable political, business and personal structure across the country, surprised many bookmakers who had hedged their bet on either Senate President Bukola Saraki or Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, to win, by almost a landslide, the presidential ticket of the major opposition party.
     
Like it was done for former President Goodluck Jonathan but with added innovations, the APC process was skewed in favour of Buhari, who garnered an unprecedented 14.8 million votes as endorsements in the novel direct primary election initiated, in the words of the party’s
National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, “to ensure participation of all party members in the emergence of our presidential candidate.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
