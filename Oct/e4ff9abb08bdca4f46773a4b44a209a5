Former International, Friday Ekpo has advised Super Eagles not to rest on their 4-0 bashing of the Mediterranean Knights of Libya, saying tomorrow’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Group E revers fixture in Tunisia could rubbish Saturday’s result in Uyo if they were not careful. A hat-trick by Odion Ighalo and another goal by Samuel Kalu gave the Eagles victory over Libya in Uyo, a win that pushed Nigeria up to the second position in Group E. Another win tomorrow will all but assure Nigeria’s qualification for next year’s championship in Cameroun. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Ekpo, who was at the stadium to support the Eagles, said though the victory was massive, there were still some grey areas in Coach Gernot Rohr’s team. “The coach still has to ensure the players took the right attitude the players on their attitude to every game. Every match needs to be approached in a very professional way. And the players on the field need to stay to the coach’s formation because I noticed some players clashing with roles not attached to them. “The players should try to put Libya under pressure, fight for every ball, keep possession of the ball and play as a team,” he said. The former Eagles’ midfielder advised Rohr to be ready with multiple plans for the game, saying the team should also be prepared for a different kind of game in Tunisia. “The coach must have a plan A, B and C so that whichever way the Libyans approach the game, he can always switch to neutralise them. I want to see a very coordinated team with players, who are ready to stick to the coach’s plans. This is a make or mar match and I pray we win. But if we lose, we are going to put ourselves under pressure, as the South Africans may want to make life difficult for us since we are meeting them in their home,” he stated.
