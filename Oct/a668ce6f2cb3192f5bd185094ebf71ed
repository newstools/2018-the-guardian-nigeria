It’s Bosses Day!! Bosses Day is a day set out to celebrate bosses and appreciate those phenomenal bosses that you can bend over backwards till your back breaks. While some use this day to rant over those horrible bosses that they secretly wish will be transferred or miraculously wouldn’t have to work with when they go to the office the next morning. While some bosses are kind and humane and make the office conducive and pleasant others are insulting and abusive, requiring their subordinates to sometimes carry out difficult tasks just to laud their power over them.
