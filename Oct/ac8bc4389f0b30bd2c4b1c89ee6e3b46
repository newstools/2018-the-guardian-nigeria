Multiple award-winning Canadian rap artist Drake recently had a gig that blew Adele away. She took to her Twitter page to express her admiration for the artist’s performance. Adele on Twitter described the show as “one of my favourite shows of all time.” Drake was honoured to have been appreciated. This is not the only time that Adele will express her impressions on a star’s performance, she once appreciated Beyonce during an acceptance speech at the Grammy’s. She added that Drake “blew my mind tonight!” “Best production I’ve ever seen hands down…” she added. Drake replied to the appreciation saying, “Oiiiiiii don’t get me gassed right now I love this woman and she came to the show,” he wrote. “Thank God nobody told me I would have been SHOOK.”
