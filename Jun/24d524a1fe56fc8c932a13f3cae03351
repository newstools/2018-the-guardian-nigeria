The Imo State House of Assembly yesterday suspended indefinitely four of its members for alleged “unparliamentary” conducts. Those sanctioned are Dr. Uche Oguwuike (Ikeduru Constituency); Nkenna Nzeruo (Oru East); Collins Chiji (Isiala Mbano) and Ifeanyi Nnataronye (Mbaitoli Constituency). At yesterday’s sitting on the floor of the assembly, the Majority Leader, Lugard Osuji (APC, Owerri Municipal) moved the motion for suspension of the lawmakers and Lawman Duruji (APC, Ehime Mbano) seconded it. Osuji alleged that the suspended legislators did not have respect for the offices they occupy. The Speaker, who presided over the sitting, ruled that the motion be carried, and the four lawmakers were suspended indefinitely. A five-man ad-hoc committee chaired by Duruji was set up to investigate the allegations and submit their report on Thursday, July 5.Other members of the panel are Henry Ezediaro (Oguta, APC); Ikechukwu Amuka (Ideato South, APC); Uche Agabiga (Orsu, APC); and Arthur Egwim (Ideato North, APC).
