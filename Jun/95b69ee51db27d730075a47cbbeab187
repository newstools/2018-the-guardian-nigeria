Adams Oshiomole Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday cautioned local government party chairmen against altering its leadership list. APC state chairman, Anselm Ojezua, gave the advice when he inaugurated elected chairmen of the 18 local government areas. Ojezua also pledged the party’s support for the chairmanship aspiration of former governor of the state, Adams Oshiomhole. He enjoined the new leaders to always abide by the constitution of the party. “You would have noticed that from the beginning of this process, we have not deviated from the constitution. Arguably, Edo State is the only place where we don’t have issues,” he said. He stressed that the good leadership of the APC in the state was responsible for the existing peace in the ward, council and state levels. According to him, if the model that Oshiomhole created was responsible for the feat, he should be supported to replicate it at the federal level. He admitted that there are challenges in the party, which Oshiomhole was capable of fixing. On the list of party executives in the wards and units, Ojezua said: “This list that had been handed over to you is not subject to alteration, or fresh negotiation. It has been monitored and approved by the delegations from the national headquarters and the leaders of our party. “The leaders that you will inaugurate later are expected to be men of integrity. It is about what they can contribute to the party to ensure that it is successful.” He charged them to pay serious attention to party organisation and mobilisation, adding that it is one thing to seek power and another thing to sustain it.
