Ariana Grande promised that something special would be dropping on the 20th day of each month leading up to her album Sweetener, well she kept her promise. Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj have released the video for their latest song “Light is coming” from Ariana’s album Sweetener. There is something extraordinary about the rhythm of the instrument, bringing a different type of vibe, this is the ultimate summer jam. If the beats sound familiar, like “Lemon” familiar, that’s because Pharrell is a producer. The official music video for “The Light Is Coming,” was directed by Dave Meyers, who also directed the video for “No Tears Left to Cry.” Watch below.
