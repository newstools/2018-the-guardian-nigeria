Chief among the changes is the introduction of a two-man attack featuring Ahmed Musa and Kelechi Iheanacho with Victor Moses and Alex Iwobi playing from the wings. “Our attack was inefficient today … you cannot score when you don’t shoot. “Alex Iwobi did well in the beginning and later Ahmed Musa came, bringing his speed to the match, he has his chances, perhaps, to start the next game, we will see.” Rohr admitted that Nigeria’s midfield was outmuscled by the experienced Croatians, adding, however, that he would stick with the Mikel, Etebo and Ndidi combinations. The trio is playing together for the first time, and according to Rohr, that made coordination a bit difficult. “We will work on the transition from midfield to attack. We have a chance to do better on Friday,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
