There is no stopping Wizkid! Not even visa issues. Our Afrobeat star walked the runway at the Dolce and Gabanna show in Milan, Italy earlier today. He strutted alongside supermodel Naomi Campbell and musician Tinie Tempah. We knew that he was taking a trip to Milan, but the singer did not disclose his reasons for visiting Italy’s most populous city. It’s no small feat that he is the first African artist to walk the runway at a Dolce and Gabbana fashion show. Add that to the fact that he walked to his single, Soco. Check out videos and photos from the Dolce and Gabbana show where the multinational fashion house revealed its 2019 Spring/Summer Men’s Collection. #AFRICATOTHEWORLD  #Repost @wizkidnews ・・・ #StarBoy bodied @dolcegabbana runway! #Soco way  #WizkidNews #DGDNA A post shared by  King SMADE (@iamsmade) on Jun 16, 2018 at 6:52am PDT  STARBOY WAY!
