It has actually been a blessing in disguise for Burna Boy and it is all thanks to Kanye West. Ever since the release of Kanye West’s Ye album, people have been accidentally finding OluwaBurna’s Ye and are listening to it.   Not only has the listens on the track gone up by 200%, it is now a top number in Nigeria. Sorry not sorry Kim  Burna Boy is grateful for that and has put up a video to appreciate the Yeezy king.
