Odd ANDERSEN / AFP Dedryck Boyata starts in Belgium’s defence as Roberto Martinez’s gifted side begin their World Cup campaign against outsiders Panama in Sochi on Monday.

Kevin De Bruyne lines up in midfield with Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens in the Red Devils’ attack. Panama’s line-up at the Fisht Stadium is as confirmed by coach Hernan Dario Gomez on the eve of the game as they make their World Cup bow. Roman Torres, whose goal against Costa Rica in qualifying secured Panama a place in Russia, captains the side from central defence.
