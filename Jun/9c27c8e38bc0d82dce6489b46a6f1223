Kwesé, Pan-African broadcast network is establishing new ways of delivering broadcasting services in a manner that will transform and change the African narrative.Mr. Zachary Wazara, Econet Media Executive, stated this while addressing journalists during the opening of the Ultramodern Kwesé Customer Experience Centre, in Lagos recently. Wazara said: “we are really establishing new ways of delivering broadcasting and I hope and pray that for you as people in the media you will be able to take advantage of this, and begin to put together that African narrative in a manner that will transform our continent. We are introducing competition, we are introducing a platform for the African narrative.”He explained that, their focus is to make Kwesé a sports and entertainment destination for Africa, adding that Kwesé is about inspiring people and presenting them in an authentic sense. He noted that Kwesé free sports (KFS) is a digital terrestrial television that is currently in 23 countries, and have signed up broadcasting agreement with Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON) to bring the world cup to vast majority of Nigerians, ordinarily not covered by pay TV.“In Nigeria, for the world cup our KFS business has signed up with BON, so that, instead of 4.5 million pay TV customers watching the world cup, we can now take the world cup to between 100 and 120 million people. “So the free to Air business is really intended to extend the reach to the population in Africa, recognizing the fact that, not everyone can afford pay TV.“Now, the key thing is why KFS, because all sports when presented has always been on pay TV and KFS gives an opportunity to the average African out there to watch Formula 1, to watch NBA at the highest level, to watch boxing at the highest level, to watch every single sports that is out there, like crickets, soccer, rugby and so on, because Africa is been restricted to only soccer. “But if our people are going to be integrated into the global economy, if our children are going to find opportunity like the Europeans, they have to take up careers in sports, look at Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, both have made over 100 million US dollar because sports was for them a career.
