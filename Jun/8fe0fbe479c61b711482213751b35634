President Muhammadu Buhari alleged fixation on winning the next presidential election instead of focusing on leading Nigeria is responsible for the Plateau killings, People’s Democratic Party said on Monday. Reports put the number of people killed at more than 100. The attacks, said to have started at about 11:00 pm on Saturday, occurred in the three local government areas of Barkin Ladi, Riyom and Jos South. “It is most disheartening that compatriots are being killed daily because of those saddled with the responsibility of safeguarding lives care less about the well-being and safety of the people, as they focused only on their ill-fated 2019 re-election bid,” the party’s spokesman Kola Ologbodiyan said in a statement on Monday. He claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to bring the perpetrators of past killings to justice has given them more strength to strike. He said, “the PDP insist that President Buhari’s failure to address and bring the book, the perpetrators of killing and bloodletting in various part of the country is emboldening insurgents and marauders to further attack and murder defenseless Nigerians,” While consoling the relatives and victims of the killings, the PDP urged the president to get to the root of the killings and bring the perpetrators to justice. “Finally, while PDP commiserates with the victims of the attack, we totally reject these killings and demand an immediate concrete stop to get to the root of the matter and end this bloodletting in our land, “ Ologbondiyan said.
