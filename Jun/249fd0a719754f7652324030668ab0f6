AFP PHOTO / Ian KINGTON Super Eagles’ Coach Gernot Rohr has described Nigeria’s last Group D match against Argentina as akin to the World Cup final, which his team must win. Speaking after Nigeria’s 2-0 defeat of Iceland yesterday, Rohr said in the second half he had to make the players realized they had to do more and that was why they came out with a fight. We changed our organisation with a 3-5-2 formation, which helped us to create more space. “Ahmed Musa’s speed will be very interesting for us in this World Cup. Iceland is a good team and I praise them for giving us a good fight. “Game against Argentina is like the final. We played against them without Messi. But we know we can do it. My young team has humility, determination and eager to learn. “They made mistakes that you should expect from a young team, but we are working on them. As I said earlier, this team is being prepared for the 2022 World Cup, but the team is learning by the day. “We had to speak to the players to convince them to accept the tactical changes. In the past two years, Mikel and Moses were playing offensive, but we did well today,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
