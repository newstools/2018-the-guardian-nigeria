Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have whisked away Otobong Ukpong, an official of the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC), serving in Ukanafun local council in Akwa Ibom State. The incident occurred near the Government Primary School, Oruk Ata2, on Ukanfun-Azumini expressway.According to the victim’s brother, Mbetobong Ukpong, “my brother was kidnapped at Uruk Ata2 on Tuesday morning, on his way to work in his office at Ukanafun.”He said the hoodlums blocked the victim at the volatile area of Uruk Ata2, where militants have been laying siege, and have kidnapped four church elders, killed four others and burnt houses recently. Mbetobong explained that his brother was on an official duty despite the insecurity in the area, to distribute Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) to the electorates in line with the directive of the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mr. Mike Igini.He said the militants have contacted the family, demanding N10 million, even as the family lamented that the excruciating economic situation has made such demand less realistic. “They used my brother’s phone number to call the family to disclose their ransom before they can release him, but the elders of the family have told them such demand is outrageous for a largely peasant family to pay,” he said. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Macdon Ogbeche, said the police is acting on the matter, adding that, the Commissioner of Police has visited the area following series of killings and abduction of two female students of Obong University, a private varsity, in the area.
