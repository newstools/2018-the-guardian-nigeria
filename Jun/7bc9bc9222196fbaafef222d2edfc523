More than 35,000 Americans were killed on the Korean Peninsula during the war, which ended in an armistice with no peace treaty. Among them, 7,700 are still considered missing, including 5,300 in North Korea alone, according to the Pentagon. Between 1990 and 2005, the United States was granted the repatriation of 229 sets of remains from the North under an earlier agreement that was subsequently suspended when ties between the two countries deteriorated.
