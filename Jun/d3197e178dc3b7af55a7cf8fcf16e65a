The Edo State Head of Service, Mrs. Gladys Idahor, has commended the board chairman, Edo State Sickle Cell Centre, Prof. (Mrs.) Caroline Omoti, for her initiative in repositioning the sickle cell centre through various innovations introduced to ensure effective management of the centre. Represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, Mrs. Stella-Maris Imasuen, who made the commendation during the presentation of self-care tool kits to people with sickle cell in Benin City by the Tonymay Foundation, she said the centre has become a model following effective management of the sickle cell sufferers. Chairman, Tonymay Foundation, Andrew Otokhina, lauded the state government for providing adequate medical care. He appealed to the governor to consider running the centre on a 24 hours basis. Donating the medical relief materials to the centre, Otokhina advised sufferers to always be hydrated, never allow themselves fall into malaria crisis, avoid stress and infection for children in a bid to live a normal life. He said being a sickle cell sufferer is not a disease but a disorder and can be managed by medical professionals. Chairman of the board, Prof. Omoti, who appreciated the donation, appealed for more attention to the centre through allocation of funds, as well as education and research to assist sufferers in provision of sustainable medical care.   Omoti disclosed that the number of patients at the centre has increased from 4,000 in 2014 to 7,573 in 2017. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
