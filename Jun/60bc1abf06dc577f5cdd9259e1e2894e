A petrol dealer in Ado Ekiti, Mr. D. Alalade, and his wife have been kidnapped. Alalade is the manager of one of the BOVAS Petroleum and Gas Limited filling stations in the state.  A source, who escaped from the scene, confirmed to journalists that the couple were kidnapped at Efon Alaaye in Efon Local Government Area at about 4:00 p.m., last Friday. The source said the couple’s family had been contacted and a N20m ransom was being demanded to secure their release.The source further said the kidnappers, who resembled Fulani herdsmen in military camouflage, waylaid the victim’s vehicle between Efon and Erio Ekiti. According to him, the abductors, numbering six, wielded sophisticated weapons.  “As they waylaid their car, the occupants of the vehicle coming behind them quickly ran into the bush.  They even shot into the air to scare us, but we ran for our lives.  We even thought they were robbers until we learnt that they have called their victim’s family,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ekiti Command, Mr. Caleb Ikechukwu, said he has not been briefed about the incident.
