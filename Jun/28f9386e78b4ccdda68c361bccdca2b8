Melania Trump was hospitalized in May, undergoing an embolization procedure for a “benign” kidney condition, according to Grisham. Embolization is most frequently used to cut off the flow of blood to a tumor or growth. The first lady has not participated in a public event since returning from the hospital in mid-May. She sought to quell speculation about her health last week, tweeting that she was “feeling great” and was at the White House “working hard on behalf of children and the American people!” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
