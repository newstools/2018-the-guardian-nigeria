It said the PQE was meant for would-be teachers who have met the council’s conditions for registration, certification, licensing and have been cleared to sit for the examination. Registra/Chief Executive of the Council, Professor Josiah Olusegun Ajiboye, in a statement by Head, Press and Protocols, Ojewuyi Olumuyiwa in Abuja, yesterday stated that over 20,000 teachers have been cleared to sit for the Batch ‘A’ examination nationwide. Ajiboye said: “We have cleared 22,202 teachers for the Batch ‘A’ examination at designated computer-based examination centres in the 36 states of the federation and Abuja. “The examination will hold on Saturday, June 9, 2018 in all the states of the federation and the FCT except Bauchi, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano and Taraba states, where it will hold on Thursday, June 7 and Friday, June 8, 2018.” He explained that the council received over 30,000 applications for the Batch ‘A’ examination, while about 8,000 applicants were rejected due to insufficient credentials and other technical reasons, adding that only those who succeeded in the screening processes were shortlisted for the test. Considering the statistics, Ajiboye noted that the number of applicants for the Batch ‘A’ exercise was impressive but could be better, stressing that private schools were also responding in bits but that the council will respond to them in due course.
