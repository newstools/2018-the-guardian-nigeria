Cardi B has no problem with being the fourth woman to have a baby with her fiancé, Offset. “People want to make fun of me, saying I’m the fourth baby mom, [but] I know I’m not having a baby with a s–tty ass man,” the 25-year-old rapper — who is due to give birth to her first child in July — told Rolling Stone in a joint cover story with the Migos member, 26, published on Wednesday, June 20.

She told the publication that she plans to bring her baby girl with her when she opens for Bruno Mars’ 24K Magic world tour beginning in September. “What I envision is my tour bus has my own personal room, and I just want to be with my baby,” she said. “Only time I don’t have my baby with me is when I’m getting my hair done, makeup done, performing. I don’t want to miss one second. I don’t want to miss no smiles, I don’t want to miss no new movement, I don’t want the baby to confuse me and the babysitter.” How sweet is that?
