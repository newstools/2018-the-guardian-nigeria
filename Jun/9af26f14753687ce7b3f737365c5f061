We understand there is a thin chance you’ll get along well with every one of your colleagues. There’s definitely the one who talks incessantly, the ones who can’t clean up after themselves and the ones who pass responsibilities to you. Frustrated employee.

This may seem impossible since you see the person on a daily basis but you will be surprised that if you actually make a conscious effort, you will noticeably have lesser interactions with this person. Even if the person parades the office, be too busy to stop what you are doing. Workitdaily.com says, “When you reduce your interaction with someone it often improves your interaction with them.” Compromise
Try to meet your co-worker halfway and be open to his or her own way of doing things. You may just be able to deal with it. Do not insist on always getting it done your way. After all, you may be working with this person for weeks, months and maybe even years. Remember, it is just professional
No matter how upset you get, remember you only have to deal with them until work closes and you are not going to take them home with you at the end of the day. The realisation that it is only temporary helps you ignore and tolerate annoying as well as irritating situations. That, in turn, helps you control your temper. Stay positive
Try to stay positive despite the insanity. We understand that is almost impossible but you are more likely to get cooperation from other co-workers this way.
