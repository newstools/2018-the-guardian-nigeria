 Makarfi  Makarfi, who spoke with journalists in Jos yesterday after a meeting with the delegates of the party from Plateau State, said he would not politicise the issue of security because it is a matter that affects everybody. He told the delegates that he was at the secretariat to ask them to consider him as one of the presidential aspirants, saying: “People are saying I have not started from my home. Plateau State is my home. I have been coming here since 1970s. Besides, we started PDP here with people like Damishi Sango who is now the PDP chairman in the state. “I am not the only presidential aspirant that has come out. Others will still come out. I am not engaging any of them. I hate injustice. I like justice. I appeal to you delegates to be fair.” In his remark, Sango described Makarfi as an unassuming gentleman with courage, adding that he is a man who fought the battle and won the soul of the PDP, which they are all proud of. Meanwhile, the PDP has called for a collective effort to vote out the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in Kogi State. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, who spoke during a courtesy visit to the party’s national secretariat in Abuja by the immediate past governor of Kogi State, Captain Idris Wada, lamented that the level of governance in Kogi State is abysmally low and the indigenes have become worse off since the APC administration came on board. Ologbondiyan challenged all party leaders to intensify the campaign of marketing the PDP in their respective domains.
