Emotional Intelligence is an essential part of a whole person. It is the ability to identify and manage your own feelings and the feelings of others. Emotions drive people, people drive performance. These feelings can be seen as the power source, which brings about performance in people. For an individual to be able to produce great result, his or her emotions have a major role to play in how they perform and get results. A person going through depression or stress will produce little or no output. Emotions, which can also be described as human electricity, bring about productivity and this results to high or low performance. Exercise: Notice whether you are in a good mood when you come to a decision point. Or close your eyes and remember something that makes you generally happy: a favorite television show, learning, chatting with a friend, relaxing for a few minutes with a book or having a good laugh. Remembering something emotionally positive, helps bring about that positive emotion.
When it comes to the workplace, there are three levels of emotions that affect productivity: 1. Short-lived Emotions: These types of emotions are affected by what is happening at a particular time. Most times, these feelings are caused by various triggers of the moment. Examples are: Anger, Fear, Disgust, Excitement, etc.
1. Long-term Emotions: This has to do with a person’s mood swing, which can either be negative or positive. This can lead to a person completely shutting down or being in a happy frame of mind. Example: Depression. 2. Personality Traits or Dispersion: This involves a particular mindset, which an individual can develop due to his or her environment. For example, growing up in a family of so much hate and resentment can affect how a person views life.
Most people are ignorant of the energy that flows from them. Emotions are so powerful that an individual emits these feelings consciously or unconsciously. People are unaware of the source, triggers and the influence these emotions have over their lives – how it affects them, the people in their space, and finally, how to control it. In Nigeria, there are various issues that can affect a person’s state of mind, such as: traffic, marriage, finance, economy, etc. These problems can cause stress to the body. The concept of stress has to do with how a person interprets his existence in an environment. Stress shuts a person down and releases hormones such as Cortisol, which can slow his or her productivity. Research over the years has proven that 85 per cent of success or productivity in life is predicated upon how emotionally intelligent an individual is; and the first level of emotional intelligence involves Self-Awareness. Each emotion, for example: happy, sad, anxious, hopeful and more, may be perfectly suited to improve your performance on certain types of tasks. Although we may not always be aware of it, many of the tasks we perform, whether we are answering a colleague’s email or engaging in a tough negotiation with a supplier has a lot to do with our emotions. The reason emotions have a surprisingly powerful effect on our performance is that they have adaptive value, which helps people cope and respond to the situation at hand.
