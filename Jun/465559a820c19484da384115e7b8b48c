Heartburns contrary to what many people think is a symptom rather than a disease. It is a symptom of Gastro-esophageal reflux disease or “acid reflux” which is caused when the acid produced in the stomach leaks out and seeps back into the oesophagus or food pipe. It often starts as a slight hiccup, followed by a burning sensation in your chest and throat. It may be triggered by the foods you eat, particularly spicy, fatty, or acidic foods. It can also be that you have gastroesophageal reflux disease, a chronic condition with many potential causes. Whatever the cause, there are ways to avoid and treat heartburn strikes: Chew gum
Sounds ridiculous but according to an article published in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics, chewing gum for half an hour after meals is one way to reduce heartburn as it stimulates saliva production and swallowing which helps dilute and clear stomach acid from your oesophagus. chewing gum Photo credit Pinterest Mix baking soda with water
You may not have to see a doctor after every heartburn strike as you would most likely have a remedy at hand in your kitchen, without even knowing it. Dissolve a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it slowly as this would help neutralize your stomach acid. Baking soda with water Photo credit Pinterest Try ginger
According to a post in Harvard’s Healthbeat, ginger has been used as a folk remedy for heartburn for centuries.
