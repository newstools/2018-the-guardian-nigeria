All hail the Greatest Of All Time (G.O.A.T). Argentina and Barcelona star, Lionel Messi, at a recent interview with Paper Magazine did not just show that he is the G.O.A.T but also a lover of goats. He modelled alongside the animals at La Granja Natura, a farm and educational centre. He explains that he shares a closer relationship with the animals that we think. “I am a big fan of animals. I grew up with them and they have taught me many things. Now we have our dog Hulk who really is part of the family, we always include him. Our children learn so much from Hulk: The love shown between him and the kids and the kids and him is constant.” We hope he proves his G.O.A.T status at the World Cup.
