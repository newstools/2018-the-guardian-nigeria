 Oshiomhole  He told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Friday that his optimism was based on Oshiomhole’s “credibility and strong connections’’ in Delta. Oshiomhole, a former governor of neighbouring Edo, is set to be the new national chairman of APC at the party’s national convention holding in Abuja on Saturday. The coast became clear for him after his last standing challenger, a former governor of Cross River, Me Clement Ebri, withdrew from the race on Thursday.
Abijor said, “you know Delta and Edo are neighbours, having been carved out of the former Bendel state, and APC is in power in Edo. “Whether you like it or now, Oshiomhole is a formidable political force in this country, besides being a man of high credibility. “Again, he has good friends and strong influence in Delta, and I strongly believe that with him as national chairman, APC will take over the state in 2019.’’ Abijor dismissed speculation that the National Convention will deepen the crisis rocking the party, saying those expecting such outcome would be disappointed.
He also expressed confidence that Oshiomhole’s leadership would finally resolve the crisis and reposition the APC for victory in 2019. “ Oshiomhole has what it takes to resolve the party’s crisis. It is not easy to govern a state like Edo, which is politically difficult like Delta. “If you check the time of Oshiomhole as governor, there was peace in Edo and in the state chapter of the party. “When you add that to his background as a former labour leader, with all the negotiation skills that come with it, I have no doubt he can settle the party’s problems before the elections,’’ he said.
