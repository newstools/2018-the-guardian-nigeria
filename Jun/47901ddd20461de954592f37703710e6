Deputy leader of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Ebenezer Ade Alagbada, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Alagbada, who announced his defection yesterday at a press conference in Ado Ekiti, said he took the decision after consulting his constituents. The lawmaker, who is from the same town with Dayo Adeyeye, said Fayose had at the PDP’s primaries in 2014, promised to rotate the governorship to his constituency, Ise Orun. He said: “We were therefore very hopeful when two of our illustrious sons, Dayo Adeyeye and Owoseeni Ajayi came out to show interest in the governorship. “But, my constituency was surprised when non of the two aspirants from my area was found worthy of the governor’s support.” He alleged that Fayose manipulated the process to pick his deputy, Kolapo Olusola-Eleka as his successor. According to him, Olusola-Eleka was not part of those that took the risk to ensure Fayose’s victory at the primaries and governorship election. He said Adeyeye and Ajayi had since left in protest to join the APC, adding: “My constituency too, which elected me into the House of Assembly is aggrieved and directed me to follow my leaders. “Consequently, in accordance with the directive of the good people of Ise/Orun constituency, I hereby resign as the deputy majority leader of the House, as well as membership of the PDP, to join the APC. Alagbada is the second PDP member to leave the party for the opposition. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
