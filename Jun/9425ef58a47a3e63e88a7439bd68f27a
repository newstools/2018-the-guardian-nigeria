 15th WIMBIZ Conference 1  Chairperson, Executive Council WIMBIZ, Olubunmi Aboderin-Talabi, said the ideology of the event is to draw attention to the value of human beings, for CEOs and policy-makers to come up with ideas on how best to invest in people in order to help them meet all their physiological needs, so that they can be more proactive citizens. “As an NGO, our focus is to use our platform to shed light on diverse issues with the aim to impact on people who would in turn, make a change in their organisations and the country as a whole. “So we hope that the ideas we platform will cause them to think about ways they can innovatively invest in people” she said.Aboderin-Talabia further explained that each community in the country is more likely to be proactive and productive if the basic needs of people are met through proper healthcare, education, shelter, clean air, security and housing.“So if we can take care of these basic needs, people would be more focused, productive and less stressed, with self-actualisation that would benefit the development and growth of the nation,” she said. Catherine Bickerseth, the Founder and Co-Director of Strategic Education Advisory Services Limited anchored the event, which took place at Wheatbaker Hotel in Lagos, where she staged panelists who headlined education, healthcare and agriculture as the primary areas that must be massively invested on for sustainable development in Nigeria.Kehinde Nwani, a Social Entrepreneur said, the importance of education to a country’s growth and development couldn’t be overemphasized, as the multiplier effect itself is education. “Without education, we’re going nowhere close to development as a country. We need to invest in education for improvement.“Most importantly, we need to improve rural education in Nigeria because children in the rural areas barely go to school” she said.Nwani further said that stakeholders must focus on teachers training and development, in order to enhance education in Nigeria, as the quality of teachers determines quality of education. Yaw Nsarkoh, Executive Vice President of Unilever Ghana and Nigeria, said the starting point to growth and development in business and the country at large is to make available everything that contributes to growth by erecting proper incentive system. “The biggest transformation in the world is to provide a child qualitative education.“It is very important to focus on everything that attributes positive change and growth to make a difference in the society because, when you’re successful as an organisation or nation, the numeric impact is higher,” he said. Adepeju Adebajo, Ogun State Commissioner for Agriculture, opines that food security aids national security and at such there must be provision for input at subsidised level.“We should address issues of land, input, organisation of farmers and other factors to stimulate agriculture.“As a country, we must be able to grow what we eat, and eat what we produce” she said.
