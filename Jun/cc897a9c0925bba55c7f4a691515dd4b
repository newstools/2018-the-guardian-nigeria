 This year’s World Environment Day theme is ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’  Globally, government officials outlined plans from communities large and small aimed at beating plastic pollution through civic engagement and celebration. They promise to make this the largest and most substantial World Environment Day ever. “Beat Plastic Pollution”, the theme for World Environment Day 2018, is a call to action for all of us to come together to combat one of the great environmental challenges of our time. The theme invites us all to consider how we can make changes in our everyday lives to reduce the heavy burden of plastic pollution on our natural places, our wildlife – and our own health,” he said. “World Environment Day is not just a celebration of the wonder of the natural world it is an opportunity to reflect on our relationship with that world and mobilize global action for causes that unite us,” Erik Solheim, Head of UN Environment said. “The world is waking up to the fact that plastic pollution is one of the most urgent environmental issues of our time, but that it’s also something that we can solve. This year’s World Environment Day is therefore a call to action for all of us.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
