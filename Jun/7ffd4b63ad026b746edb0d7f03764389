The Nigeria National team departed from Austria earlier on Thursday with native attires as they chose to be different from the other 31 teams who were mostly dressed in suits on arrival. From head to toe, the Nigerian squad have indulged in their culture and clearly have no intentions of blending in with the crowd other nations looking to upset the odds in Russia. The Eagles are boxed in the ‘Group of Death’ in Russia, which features Argentina, Iceland, Croatia. They enter the competition as one of the lowest ranked sides, 48th in the FIFA rankings, and third favourites to make it out of their group. This is Nigeria’s sixth appearance at the World Cup since making a debut show at the USA 1994. It is expected that Coach Gernot Rohr and his men will resume training on Wednesday. The team will be seeking its first win in their opening game of the World Cup in 20 years when they clash with Croatia on Saturday.
