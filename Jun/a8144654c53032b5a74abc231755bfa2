Time: 4:00 pm
Venue: Luzhniki Stadium This match pitches World Cup defending champions, Germany, against possibly the strongest opponent in Group F, Mexico. Mexico is the first CONCACAF side to qualify for the World Cup, topping their fifth round group table. Germany will be hoping for a repeat of 2014 when they comfortably beat highly-rated Portugal 4 – 0 in their first game in Brazil. Although Germany has a lot of changes in their team and to talk of one, Mario Gotze did not make the final 23 for Russia. This is the first match in Group F and will see the two sides meet for the twelfth time. Mexico will look to avenge the 4 – 1 defeat in their last encounter against Die Mannschaft when they were knocked out of the Confederation Cup last year June. In all, Germany boast of six wins. Mexico sole victory was back in 1985 – against West Germany. Possible Lineups
Germany: Neuer; Kimmich, Boateng, Hummels, Hector; Khedira, Kroos; Goretzka; Muller; Draxler; Werner Mexico:  Ochoa; Salcedo, Ayala, Moreno, Layun; Reyes; Herrera, Guardado, Lozano; Vela; Hernandez Did you know?
