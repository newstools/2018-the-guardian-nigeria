This persistent improvement was attributed largely to the positives that have translated into improved access to forex by businesses, particularly since the launch of Investors’ and Exporters (I&E) FX window in April 2017.The manufacturing PMI expanded to 56.5 points, growing at a slower pace compared to 56.9 points recorded in April 2018, due to a slower increase in two components of the index – Inventories (58.7 points) and new orders (54.9 points). Similarly, the non-manufacturing PMI, expanded to 57.3 points, 0.2 points lower than 57.5 points recorded in April 2018, with a slower growth rate in three components of the index – Business activity (58.7 points), New orders (55.9 points) and Inventories (59.2 points).The I&E Window had opened the week’s trading with the naira flat at N361.57/$ and by midweek, it depreciated by 45 kobo to N362.02/$, but reversed the losses with N1.05 and 12 kobo gians on Thursday and Friday respectively, to close the week at N360.85/$.
