• Woman gets two-year jail term for fake medical report Detectives in Lagos have exposed a fake lawyer who had been operating at Ojo Magistrate’s Court for three years. Police spokesman, Chike Oti, identified the suspected fake lawyer as Mr. Uche Julian Nwajiakwu. According to him, the arrest of Nwajiakwu by officers at Ojo Division, on May 25, marks the second time a fake lawyer would be arrested at Ojo Magistrate Court. The first was the arrest of one Chris Elisha, who was nabbed on February 6, 2018, after being in illegal practice for 15 years. He said that Nwajiakwu had been practicing illegally since 2015. The suspect allegedly told the police that he fell in love with law practice when his friend commissioned him to act as a lawyer in order to serve his tenant a quit notice and he was handsomely rewarded after the deed was done.Nwajiakwu was arrested on May 25, while he was arguing on a bail application for his client when intelligent lawyers at the court became suspicious. The lawyers allegedly said his quackery was too obvious to be ignored. Oti told newsmen: “The police investigation into the case, thus far, revealed that the suspect did not study law in any of the Nigerian universities nor anywhere else in the world. He was charged to Ojo Magistrate Court last week, for the offence of impersonation. “In view of this incident, the Commissioner of Police, reiterated his warning to professional bodies to properly scrutinise people professing to be members of their body. According to the CP, this is one incident too many and must be checked. The CP noted that the Command had in the recent months, arrested fake medical doctors and other spurious health workers, including fake journalists.” Meanwhile, for being in possession of fake medical reports from a Maitama, Abuja district hospital, a woman, Miss Inaku Victoria Oko, has been convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment by Justice Olukayode A. Adeniyi of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.Miss Oko was brought before the court by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and accused of procuring a fake medical report in the name of one Aniukwu Richard Chinonso, which was intended to enable him to travel to India for medical treatment. The commission, in a four-count charge, said that the convict also procured a fake chemical pathology laboratory report form in the name of the same Chinonso, which was intended to support a visa application that would enable to him travel abroad.Miss Oko was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail without an option of fine on each of the four counts. The sentences will run concurrently. The offences on which she was convicted violated Section 363 of the Penal Code CAP, 532 Laws of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja 2006 and punishable under section 364 of the same law.Part of the counts reads: “That you Oko Victoria Inaku (f), on the 29th of October, 2014 or thereabouts, at the Maitama District Hospital, Abuja, made a false document to wit: Medical Report in the name of one Aniukwu Richard Chinonso, allegedly signed by a doctor in the hospital, knowing same to be forged and intending that the same shall be dishonestly used as genuine to support a visa application to enable Aniukwu Richard Chinonso (now at large) to travel to India for medical treatment and you thereby committed an offence contrary to section 363 and punishable under section 364 of the Penal Code CAP, 532 Laws of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja 2006.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
