Candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Akinloye Ayegbusi, yesterday cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against hate campaigns. Ayegbusi, who made the call during his ward-to-ward campaign in Ekiti East Local Council Area, said such campaigns are overheating the polity, ahead of the July 14 governorship election.He said the two parties have engaged in a war of attrition by raising false accusations against each other, rather than telling the electorate what they have in stock for them. Ayegbusi enjoined the parties to stop dragging the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) into their messy war, and face campaigns based on issues.He told the people that he was not seeking the mandate for selfish reasons, adding that God has blessed him already. The SDP candidate said he went into the race to liberate the people from poverty and untold hardship caused by the misrule of the APC and the PDP administrations.Some of the communities he visited were Omuo, Isinbode and Ilasa, where he canvassed for their votes. At Isinbode, he paid homage to the Onisin, Oba Emmanuel Adeyemi, and appealed for their support, so that they could get the desired dividends of democracy.He urged the people to think of their future before casting their votes, adding that the SDP government would bring back prosperity to Ekiti State. The Onisin canvassed peace, before and during the election, while at Omuo and Ilasa communities, he visited the Olomuo, Oba Noah Omonigbehin, and the Alasa, where he told his supporters that a vote for the SDP would provide employment, reduce poverty and guarantee social welfare for the elderly.“Our plan for these border town communities, if you vote for us, is to create infrastructures that would aid trade with the neighbouring states,” he said.
