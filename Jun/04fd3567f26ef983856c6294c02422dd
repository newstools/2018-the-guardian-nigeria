The Three Lions led by Gareth Southgate are not weighed down by the crushing expectations of the fans and the country for this World Cup. However with the quality in their ranks, the relaxed young side should defeat Tunisia. After three African teams before them have come up with losses, Tunisia will hope they are not the fourth. Tunisia are a side that could realistically frustrate England with their defending and counterattacks. The Carthage Eagles impressed in the build up to the tournament against Spain and Portugal, holding Portugal to a draw and narrowly losing to Spain. Tunisia will hope to avenge the 2-0 group stage loss to England 20 years ago in the France 1998 World Cup. Wahbi Khazri and Naim Sliti will give Tunisia the cutting edge in attack as they begin their sojourn in the tough looking Group G. Did you know: England have not lost any of their last ten games. Possible line up Тunisia: Mouez Hassen; Yassine Meriah, Syam Ben Youssef, Dylan Bronn, Ali Maaloul; Ellyes Skhiri, Anice Badri, Ferjani Sassi; Fakhreddine Ben Youssef, Wahbi Khazri, Naim Sliti. England: Jordan Pickford; Kyle Walker, John Stones, Harry Maguire; Kieran Trippier, Dele Alli, Jordan Henderson, Jesse Lingard, Ashley Young; Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane.
