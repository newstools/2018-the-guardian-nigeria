Terry Crews has said that he was sexually assaulted in 2016 by Adam Venit, a Hollywood talent agent. Testifying in front of the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee, he got emotional as he explained that his genitals were groped by the agent while his wife looked on. He told CA Senator Dianne Feinstein that he feared to react lest he be given the stereotypical judgement of a violent black man. He also said that Expendables producer Avi Lerner advised him to drop the case if he wanted to appear in another Expendables. Recall that he was asked to undergo a 7-hour “mental status testing and psychological testing” when the allegations surfaced in May. Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson who had earlier mocked him with an Instagram caption “LOL, What the f*ck is going on out here man? Terry: I froze in fear. they would have had to take me to jail. get the strap” after a shirtless Crews posted “I got raped. My wife just watched” has taken down the post.
