Having to decide what to wear to work in the new week could be a burden to many people. The workplace or environment is a factor to consider when choosing clothes for the new week. Some workplaces allow for casual appearances. Others are quite strict and only approve of corporate outfits. The millennial culture is catching on, and jeans are now becoming more acceptable in the workplace. Here are five tips to rock your jeans stylishly and professionally. A blazer can transform any look into a professional one. Brighten up your casual jeans with either a light or dark-coloured blazer. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-657039 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-263x598.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="2044" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-263x598.jpg 263w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-507x1152.jpg 507w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-245x557.jpg 245w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-491x1114.jpg 491w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-106x240.jpg 106w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-211x480.jpg 211w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest-264x600.jpg 264w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jeans.-Photo-credit-pinterest.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-657025 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mg75uk-l-610x610-shoes-tumblr-gloveheel-highheels-blackheels-denim-jeans-bluejeans-bag-greybag-ribbed-550x598.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="979" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mg75uk-l-610x610-shoes-tumblr-gloveheel-highheels-blackheels-denim-jeans-bluejeans-bag-greybag-ribbed-550x598.jpg 550w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mg75uk-l-610x610-shoes-tumblr-gloveheel-highheels-blackheels-denim-jeans-bluejeans-bag-greybag-ribbed-487x530.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mg75uk-l-610x610-shoes-tumblr-gloveheel-highheels-blackheels-denim-jeans-bluejeans-bag-greybag-ribbed-221x240.jpg 221w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mg75uk-l-610x610-shoes-tumblr-gloveheel-highheels-blackheels-denim-jeans-bluejeans-bag-greybag-ribbed-441x480.jpg 441w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mg75uk-l-610x610-shoes-tumblr-gloveheel-highheels-blackheels-denim-jeans-bluejeans-bag-greybag-ribbed-552x600.jpg 552w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mg75uk-l-610x610-shoes-tumblr-gloveheel-highheels-blackheels-denim-jeans-bluejeans-bag-greybag-ribbed.jpg 561w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> Wearing a great set of shoes, like heels, can boost your looks and confidence. Wear a classic pair of pumps in either nude or black and you will go from casual to formal in seconds. Dark jeans are more appropriate for work as they appear to be more conservative than light-coloured jeans which look casual and laid back. It is best to save your dark jeans for the office and lighter shades for your days of fun. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-657029 size-large lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-769x1152.jpg" alt="" width="769" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-769x1152.jpg 769w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-372x557.jpg 372w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-743x1114.jpg 743w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas-400x600.jpg 400w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Style-pantry-jeans-ideas.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /> Nothing says formal than a well tucked in shirt in either a skirt or pair of jeans. Perfect this look by throwing on a belt and corporate shoes. Classic cuts look more professional than casual. Itâ€™s always safer to go for something comfortable and a bit roomy. Try wide-legged or boot-leg cut jeans.
