Some of the fans, who were at the venue to cheer the Eagles, broke down in tears as the referee sounded his final whistle. Former international, Wilson Oruma and former Golden Eaglets captain, Olusegun Fetuga, lamented openly as the Eagles wasted chances that should have given them ticket over the Argentines. “This is a game we should have won,” one of the fans, who identified himself as Danladi lamented. “I knew it was going to be a great game, but after we equalised, I thought the Eagles would go ahead. I am really sad over this defeat… How come Argentina will always defeat Nigeria in their last group match?” Oruma blamed the defeat on the inability of the Super Eagles to take their chances. “I will blame our players for not taking their chances,” Oruma stated. “In a big match like this, you must take your chances. Perhaps, if our players had made good use of the chances that came their way, we could have got at worst a draw, which would have been enough for Nigeria to scale through. “I won’t single a particular player for blame, but I put the blame on the team.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
