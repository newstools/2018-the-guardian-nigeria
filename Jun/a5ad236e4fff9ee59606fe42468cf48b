Mashi, who commissioned the BUK meteorological station, noted that without weather and climate, there cannot be life, and by extension, development. He added that with collaborations, the negative effects associated with weather and climate would be reduced, due to the efficacy of forecasts issued by NiMet. Responding, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Muhammad Bello, restated his commitment to working with NiMet, promising to adhere to the obligations, as prescribed in the MoU. The collaboration between NiMet and BUK will also involve training staff of the university on instrumentation and accurate weather forecasting.
