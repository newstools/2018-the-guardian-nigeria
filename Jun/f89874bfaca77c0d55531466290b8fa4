Oyo State Government has shut down Bodija market after a fight that broke out between police and butchers in the early hours of Thursday. The butchers, who were protesting their relocation by the state government to a central abattoir, accused their leaders of taking gratification from the state government. This led to major conflict and sporadic shootings in the major market of the state. The unrest has prompted the state Government to halt all activities in the market indefinitely. “The Oyo State Government has shut down Bodija market for security reasons,” Oyo State said in a statement on Thursday. “This is an aftermath of the sporadic shooting which occurred earlier today in the market and its environs” “The closure is to prevent the loss of lives and property of the citizenry”   and  “to guard against the escalation of the violence in the market to other parts of the state.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
