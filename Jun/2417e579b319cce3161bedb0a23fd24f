The management of Emzor, the officials Pharmaceutical Company of the Super Eagles has urged the team to go all out and beat Argentina in today’s last group match at St. Petersburg. Emzor, which is positioned as the nation’s number one painkiller, also enjoined the players and officials of the team to ensure that Nigeria surpasses its previous performance at the World Cup, by reaching at least the quarterfinal stage this time around. The company said its partnership with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), is yielding good dividend for all football-loving Nigerians. Emzor has been one of the major supporters of the Super Eagles since 2014, providing the needed back up to the team before and during its participation at the Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup, where the nation reached the second round. Since then, the company has not looked back in giving the national team the backing it needs to excel. Apart from the Eagles, Emzor was also the brain behind the success of the Super Falcons at the 2016 African Nations Cup won by the Coach Florence Omagbemi-led team in Cameroun. Emzor has also given some top players that include Super Falcons’ Asisat Oshoala the platform to leverage themselves outside the field of play. While entering into a partnership deal with the NFF in 2014, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Dr. Stella Okoli, OON, had explained that the motive behind the pact was to support the game loved by most Nigerians, adding that its emphasises was on the wellness of the citizens. “Emzor Paracetamol is a household brand in Nigeria, and we enjoys similar affinity by the young and old because we deliver wellness to our consumers,” Okoli stated. After the team lost 0-2 in her first game to Croatia, Emzor sent her words of encouragement to the team, even when many Nigerians had lost hope in the team progressing to the next stage of the competition. Emzor’s faith in the team paid off, as the Eagles revived the hope by beating Iceland 2-0 last Friday in their second game. “Emzor believes in the ability of the Eagles to deliver, even when people seemed to have lost hope in them. “Nigerians are passionate about football, and Emzor had to connect with the consumers at this passion point. Football is a universal unifier, and so, Emzor’s investment in sports is part of its commitments in supporting the Super Eagles and football,” Kayode stated.
