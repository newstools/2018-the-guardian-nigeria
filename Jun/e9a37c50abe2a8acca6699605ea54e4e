 Willie Obiano  Lawyer to the filling station’s management, Barr. C.I Okoye said yesterday that his clients have suffered damages amounting to N500m, while 25 workers at the station had been rendered jobless, as a result of the damage. Okoye explained that the state government had no justifiable reason to demolish the petrol station, since its owners went through due processes and obtained all necessary approvals and documents.Both from the Anambra State government and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources before building the station. He said the state governor, Willie Obiano, issued the owners a Building Certificate of Occupancy, adding that the purpose for the premises was clearly written as Residential/Commercial. He said: “We consider Anambra State government’s action in destroying our petrol station and rendering over 25 workers jobless as being callous, lawless and an application of self-help in dealing with legitimate business interest. Governor Obiano has proved that his government does not adhere to the rule of law, neither does it obey court judgments nor respect its own approvals.
