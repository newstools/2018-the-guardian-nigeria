This exempts those with other genuine business in the country provided they have the visa to cover the additional days. An official of the local organising committee told The Guardian that they have a system that could fish out any fan identification card holder, who tries to stay back in the country after the World Cup. He said their record shows that more than 15,000 fans came to Russia from West Africa, adding that some have already crossed the borders to such countries as Finland, Estonia and Belarus. “We have nothing against any ‘fan’ leaving Russia for any other country provided such person commits no crime here. But any fan who thinks he can use the fact that we are hosting the World Cup to disappear or seek asylum in Russia will have to go back to his country to do things the proper way,” he said.
