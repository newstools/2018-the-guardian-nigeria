 Governor Adams Oshiomhole .  It equally accused President Muhammadu Buhari of complicity in the acts of corruption that have pervaded his administration and party.The party, which also asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to recognise the new APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, as his emergence by affirmation is in violation of democratic requirements of direct voting by delegates, said: “In 2012, we had a convention which INEC described as a nullity because they said we did not follow the rules. “As we speak today, the coronation that the APC conducted at the Eagle Square did not fit into any of our electoral laws. And we therefore call on INEC to declare it null and void.“All those who did not go through votes at the convention, all those who were elected by voice votes, INEC must declare their elections null and void because they did not go through the electoral laws.” The PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, stated these while receiving party leaders from his home Kabba/Bunu area of Kogi State, who paid him a solidarity visit at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja yesterday. “It is unimaginable that while Nigerians are suffering untold economic hardship, including unpaid salaries, governors elected on the platform of the APC diverted N150 million each, amounting to a humongous N3.6 billion to fund their wasteful national convention in Abuja.” “Recently, the Brooking Report shows that under President Buhari and APC governors, millions of Nigerians are daily dropping below poverty line,” he alleged.Meanwhile, the National Chairman of the ruling APC, Adams Oshiomhole, has said that he does not belong to any of the conflicting groups in the party. Oshiomhole, who spoke when he met with a faction of Taraba State Chapter of the party led by Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf at the national secretariat yesterday, made reference to the unanimous support he got from the 6,800 delegates at the recently held national convention of the party to buttress his assertions.He, therefore, enjoined the party chieftains to imbibe the spirit of compromise and forgiveness, assuring that he would deploy the tool of persuasion, negotiation and reconciliation to ensure a more united and virile APC ahead of the 2019 polls.
