He said the first attack was on Friday in the Oshnaviyeh area near the border with Iraqi Kurdistan, that left seven militants “killed or wounded”. Two further attacks were reported between Saturday and Sunday — another in Oshnaviyeh and one further south in Sarvabad. Pakpour said surveillance had identified these militants before they were able “to infiltrate our country’s soil”. The clashes on Saturday and Sunday left six attackers dead and three wounded, he added, and that a considerable amount of weaponry had been recovered.
