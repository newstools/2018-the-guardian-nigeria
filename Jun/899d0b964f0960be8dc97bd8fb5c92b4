My commitment is at a maximum level,” the Argentinian said. “We need to relax and take things as they come. After that we’ll see what happens.” Zidane shocked Real by revealing he was leaving the club just days after making history by winning a third successive Champions League title. Pochettino said he could understand the pressure that the Frenchman had been under. “When a name is associated with Real Madrid, the expectations are immense… Football throws up circumstances you don’t expect and you have to make the most of it each day. “What will be, will be.” Spanish sports daily AS reported that Pochettino’s new contract does not include an agreement that he can leave Tottenham if Real make an approach for him. Pochettino led Spurs to third place in the Premier League in the just-completed season, behind Manchester United and runaway winners Manchester City.
