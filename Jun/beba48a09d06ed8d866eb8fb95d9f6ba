The panel’s executive vice chairperson, Priscilla Ankut, said the meeting was to develop a strategy and an action plan for the promotion of peace in the state. According to her, the mandate of the commission was to promote peace, harmonious co-existence as well as conflict prevention and peace-building among others. Her words: “The commission   is quite focused on building partnerships with local, international and local actors, including the media.  The media is key to sustaining peace. “We do mean well.  I believe the government that came up with the commission means well too. “We are committed to keeping the doors open, especially as we are taking off now. We have been given a mandate by the law to implement programmes.  The initiative to develop a peace curriculum is one of such. “ The permanent secretary, Khadijah Gambo, commended the participants for their leaning towards peaceful co-existence in the state. “The commission is willing to collaborate with all stakeholders in ensuring that Kaduna bounces back to enjoy the unity and peace it was known for in the past,” she stated.
