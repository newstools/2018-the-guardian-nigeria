In the northern region of Arusha close to the Kenyan border lies Tanzania’s Lake Natron. It is a salt lake that is alkaline. This lake is not very deep but it is mesmerizing, it appears to have a beautiful reflection. As beautiful as this lake appears, it is as dangerous. It turns animals to stone but this is not as a result of any mystery or folktale. It is as a result of the salt and high alkaline ph present in the water. When animals touch the water, calcification occurs and the animal dies yet appears like a stone. Every part of the body down to its hairs are still in place. The sight of these dead animals makes a very compelling image.  Read More: Ado Awaye Lake: Explore The Wonder Of Nigeria’s Only Hanging Lake  <em>Dead Buffalo on Lake Natron.
