Children and teens from different backgrounds had a fun-filled day on May 29 at all the 12 branches of SPAR Nigeria, across the country. Generously treated to activities, including games, freebies, mascots, bouncing castles and face paints, among others, the hypermarket outfit celebrated this year’s Children’s Day, as well as SPAR Kids Fun Fiesta. The Ilupeju branch of the fiesta was lit up by 2017 Miss Nigeria, Mildred Ehiguese, and actor Yomi Gold, who engaged the children and their parents in such recreational activities as the balance beam, pin the tail on the donkey, identify parent, hot potato/pass the parcel, doughnut eating and dress up contest, among others. The company’s spokesperson, John Goldsmith, said: “The yearly fiesta has become a tradition for us. Being a family oriented hypermarket, we are keen on always celebrating Children’s Day, as it gives us the privilege to appreciate and excite children. We are always happy to go the extra mile in making the day special and memorable, because today’s children are tomorrow’s leaders and evidently, tomorrow’s shoppers.” Miss Nigeria said: “SPAR has continued to be significant in the lives of children and students, especially in its host communities. The Fun Day has been so exciting for them and their parents. I am so proud of the indigenous spirit exuded by the outfit at putting smiles on our faces.” Commending the hypermarket for blazing the trail in offering shoppers the most competitive prices on household commodities and items, Gold said: “the company has set a worthy example, when it comes to engaging host communities.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
