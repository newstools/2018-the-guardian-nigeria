 Uche Secondus  Accounts and Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting for which workers now risk losing their June salaries.” The party alleged, in a statement released by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, that the entire problem at FAAC stemmed from the fact that President Buhari “abdicated his duties and opened the door for heavy sleazes and looting of funds in the oil and gas sector by his cronies and cabal in the Presidency” According to the party, “It is incontrovertible that government’s major financial earning figures could not tally at the meeting because of the sleazes in Buhari’s administration that have been left unchecked.” PDP noted, that “The Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, by asking the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to account for the missing money, is merely seeking for a scapegoat, as the buck stops at President Buhari’s table as the Minister of Petroleum Resources. “Mr. President appropriated the office of the minister of petroleum and refused all wise counsel to quit the office for a more competent hand. He therefore cannot attempt to shift blames to others where he had overtly failed,” the statement added. The party said it had “forewarned of stealing, sharp practices and sleazy subsidy deals going on in the Buhari-led petroleum sector which the Presidency had always swept under the carpet. Today, the truth lies bare for all to see.” “Our take as a party is that Nigerian workers must not be made to further suffer because of President Buhari’s manifest incompetence and the 
humongous corruption going on in the petroleum sector under his supervision” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
