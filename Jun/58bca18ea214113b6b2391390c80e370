 Buhari  According to sources President Muhammadu Buhari threw his weight behind Buni after the breaking of the Ramadan fast meeting with some of the party’s governors at the presidential villa in Abuja. A source that was privy to the meeting confirmed that President Buhari gave the marching orders to the governors,  mainly from the northeast geopolitical zone to ensure that Buni returns at the national convention of the party. A chieftain of the party, Kashim Imam is believed to be angling for the position of the national secretary. The development is coming against the backdrop of revelation by the former Secretary of the APC National convention planning committee, Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu that no fewer than 160 chieftains of the party had so far indicated interest for various positions in the National working Committee (NWC) of the party. Uwajumogu who made this known while handing over to the Chairman of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC),  Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba as the new Secretary of the national convention planning committee. Uwajumogu who explained that he stepped down from the position to enable him attend the graduation ceremony of his child abroad which incidentally coincide with the date fixed for the convention,  assured that he had put in place measures to ensure a hitch -free conduct of the exercise. Ndoma-Egba who expressed gratitude to Uwajumogu pledged to live up to the expectations of the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun led NWC in ensuring the smooth conduct of the convention.
