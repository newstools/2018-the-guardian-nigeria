 Croatian team line up for their friendly against Senegal. Twitter/@HNS_CFF Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalic has announced the team to start the match against the Super Eagles at Kaliningrad on Saturday. According to Croatian website index.hr, Dalic told journalists the exact way the team with Mario Mandzukic set to lead the line for Croatia. Dalic has restored Captain Luka Modric back to the heart of the midfield alongside Barcelona’s Ivan Rakitic ditching anchorman Milan Badelj. Modric was deployed during Croatia’s pre-World Cup friendlies in the attacking midfield role behind the main striker but will be returned to play in the double pivot behind Hoffenheim’s Andrej Kramaric. Kramaric noted after Croatia’s win against Senegal, in which he scored a goal, that the ‘Nigeria encounter in Russia will not be easy’. Kramaric, who started as the central striker in Croatia’s 2-0 loss to Brazil, will play behind Mario Mandzukic. Mandzukic last scored for the Balkans in their World Cup qualifier against Finland in June 2017. The goal stands as his only goal in his last ten appearances for Croatia. <img class="size-medium wp-image-657777 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CROATIA_TEAM-LINEUP_ASSET-484x598.png" alt="" width="484" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CROATIA_TEAM-LINEUP_ASSET-484x598.png 484w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CROATIA_TEAM-LINEUP_ASSET-451x557.png 451w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CROATIA_TEAM-LINEUP_ASSET-194x240.png 194w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CROATIA_TEAM-LINEUP_ASSET-389x480.png 389w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CROATIA_TEAM-LINEUP_ASSET-486x600.png 486w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CROATIA_TEAM-LINEUP_ASSET.png 729w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /> In the announce team, Dalic replaced former Tottenham defender Vedran Corluka with Domagoj Vida.
