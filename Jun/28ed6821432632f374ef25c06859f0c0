The Body of Benchers yesterday approved the use of hijab for law activities such as when fresh law graduates are being called to the bar.Consequently, this has given the embattled Muslim graduate of law at University of Ilorin, Amasa Firdaus Abdulsalam, the opening to wear hijab at the bar. Amasa was denied entrance to the International Conference Centre, Abuja on December 12, 2017 where the call to bar programme was to take place, as she refused to remove her headgear.The Nigerian Law School had alleged that she was breaking its dress code, but Amasa, who was already wearing her gown, insisted on wearing the wig on her hijab. A source in the Body of Benchers confirmed the development to The Guardian, saying Amasa had been invited to attend the programme next month.Director, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), Ishaq Akintola, commended the Body of Benchers for reviewing the case and for allowing professionalism to be the deciding factor.He thanked all Muslims who intervened in the matter, saying: “We are also grateful to the House of Representatives for the positive role it played in the matter. “We felicitate with all Islamic organisations as well as Muslim brothers and sisters who stood with us all these days, particularly during the aborted public hearing at the National Assembly.”Ameer, The Muslim Congress (TMC), Lukman AbdulRaheem, said: “The news is a victory for procedural justice, rule of law and constitutionalism. Amasa has registered her name as a heroine of Islam.“She demonstrated faith, patience and steadfastness in the face of harassment of Islamophobes in the Law School.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
