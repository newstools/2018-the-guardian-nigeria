 Egypt’s Mohamed Salah (C) missed his team’s defeat to Uruguay as he struggles to recover from the shoulder injury sustained during last month’s Champions League Final AFP / KARIM JAAFAR  Mohamed Salah is expected to start for Egypt today.  He will look to keep the Pharaohs World Cup hopes alive when they meet hosts Russia later today. The host are sitting on top of the group with their excellent display against Saudi-Arabia with five unexpected goals in the opening game despite a seven-game winless run ahead of the tournament. But truth be told, Russia have to put the result against Saudi Arabia behind them and face Egyptians with more focus. Salah’s presence will no doubt lift their spirits. They will be more dangerous on the attack knowing full well that beating Russia is the only option to keep their hopes. Egyptians will as well try to fight for the pride of Africa as no African country has gotten a full three points at Russia. The hosts are expected to be ready to fight hard and get another victory to put at least one foot in the next round. But they will be without one of their key players, with Alan Dzagoev expected to miss the rest of the tournament after damaging his hamstring in Thursday’s 5-o win over Saudi Arabia.
