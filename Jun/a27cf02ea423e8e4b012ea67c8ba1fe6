The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the presidency for appropriating the achievements of the National Assembly and listing them as those of President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, the PDP said the recent attempt by the Buhari Presidency to ascribe credit to Mr. President for the recent amendments to the constitution, particularly the granting of financial autonomy to state assemblies and judiciaries, was despicable. The party noted that neither the presidency nor the president himself, made any input in support of these amendments. “Equally appalling is that the presidency is still listing the passage of the “Not Too Young to Run” law as an achievement of the president even when he had no input whatsoever in the initiative. “It is instructive to note that none of the amendments stem from any executive bill and that the Buhari Presidency has never initiated any programme to enhance the course of governance in our country in the last three years,” the party added. According to the PDP, “Nigerians already know that the Buhari administration has not implemented a single project or programme in any part of the country in the last three years of governance. “Instead of seeking ways to mitigate the situation, Mr. President’s handlers are subjecting him to more public ridicule of commissioning projects executed by other leaders such as his embarrassing commissioning of a regular bus stop constructed by Lagos State and a water borehole in Jigawa.’’ The PDP however, commended the National Assembly and state houses of assembly “for their resilience in enhancing our democratic practice as consolidated by successive PDP administrations, despite the unrelenting assault on the institution of the legislature by the Buhari administration.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
