The togetherness fostered in the squad has seen Nigeria adopt a strong mentality that allows them to thrive against the odds. A young team bears the imprint of its manager, who has created a resilient counterattacking side that is capable of many surprises at the World Cup. Although Rohr has flirted with some different formations – including a 3-5-2 used in November’s 4-2 win over Argentina – it is clear that Rohr will opt for his trusted 4-2-3-1, based on defensive resilience and efficient counters. While the Super Eagles are a team greater than the sum of its parts, their strengths are pinned on the individual brilliance of a few. Rohr always looks to the collective, though, preferring in public to downplaying the importance of those who truly stand out. “We do not have such great players as Kanu or Okocha, who then shone, but the strength of this team is the teamwork,’’ Rohr told Przeglad Sportowy. “Our captain Mikel Joh Obi or Victor Moses are not the players who will decide the fate of the game themselves, like the stars from the 90s.” However, Mikel’s influence on the team is immense. The former Chelsea midfielder coordinates Nigeria’s play and dictates the pace of the game with his calm and intelligent ball distribution.   Behind Mikel are two ball winners, Ogenyi Onazi and the talented Wilfred Ndidi. They operate at the base of the midfield, acting as human shields for the back line. Both excel primarily in breaking up play but are far less convincing going forward as pivots. It is the major criticism of Nigeria’s midfield anchors: distribution and transition from defence to attack is often poor, a situation exacerbated whenever Mikel is unavailable. Rohr’s solution was to get Mikel as close to Onazi and Ndidi as possible – playing closer to the pivot than the centre-forward, Odion Ighalo, whose ability to alternate his movement keeps him from being isolated. His ability to combine smartly, dropping deep to hold up play while still managing to ghost into good scoring positions, has placed him at the spearhead of the attack. Kelechi Iheanacho remains a potent option off the bench. The attack is heavily reliant on the pace and guile of the Chelsea wing-back Moses. In Nigeria’s colours Moses is a virtuoso, adding verticality to the team’s play and speeding down the wings. Playing as a more out-and-out winger for the Super Eagles, he is the the most important player – capable of magical moments but also, at times, prone to overplaying. Rohr has stated the need for “great discipline” and “a great deal of mutual solidarity and communion”. Those traits are best embodied by the central defensive pairing of Leon Balogun and William Troost-Ekong. The pair share a deep bond and their relationship has created a solid defence that is difficult to breach. Balogun’s ball-playing abilities, matched with the imposing and physical style of Troost-Ekong, fit perfectly into the team’s style. Probable XI (3-5-2): Uzoho Balogun, Troost-Ekong, Ogu Abdullahi, Ndidi, Iwobi, Mikel, Idowu Ighalo, Moses Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup? Francis Uzoho. For a goalkeeper that has just two made senior appearances for Deportivo La Coruña, Uzoho is perhaps fortunate to get into the World Cup squad but has a good command of his area and impressive shot-stopping ability. The 19-year-old is very likely to start in goal for Nigeria – putting him in illustrious company with the likes of Peter Rufai, Ike Shorunmu and Vincent Enyeama. Which player is likely to disappoint? Alex Iwobi’s poor form for Arsenal will leave many wondering if he can deliver for the Super Eagles. After a breakout season in 2015-16 the attacking midfielder has failed to kick on, often stuttering when presented with opportunities. Too often he appears on the fringes of a game, and will need to be more assertive this summer. What is the realistic aim for Nigeria at the World Cup and why? Given that they face arguably the toughest World Cup group there is the overwhelming possibility of an early elimination, but it is plausible that they can beat Croatia and Iceland to qualify for the round of 16. Much depends on the first game against Croatia.    To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
