The official suits of the Super Eagles team for the Russia 2018 World Cup are out. The dapper suits were designed by Nigerian luxury designer David Bowler, the name behind the eponymous brand. Known for their unique collection, there is a specially designed Eagles designed outfit which they will be wearing as their uniform: This design is as authentic as Bowler’s 2016 Rio Olympics outfits. In 2016, the male athletes’ official outfit was the South-South dressing and hats while the female athletes were to adorn the long cape dress and a turban. These designs were seen as a representation of the Nigerian spirit. Sadly, the outfits were not worn at the Opening ceremony in Rio. He is also the designer behind the 2014 World Cup outfits in Brazil.
