Modric was at the centre of Croatia’s moves, playing the corner that resulted in the first goal and tucking in the second from the spot. Now buoyed by the win, the Real Madrid man believes Croatia is now primed to beat Argentina on Thursday. “Nigeria was a tough team to beat, but the world now knows that Croatia mean business in this World Cup. The win has raised our confidence and we are ready for Argentina,” Modric said at the post match conference. Modric acknowledged that Argentina would present a different type of opposition because they are desperate for points following their opening draw with Iceland, but he added they would be ready for the South Americans on Thursday.
