Taylor Swift is a fiery red-haired secretary in Sugarland’s new video Babe. In the Mad Men inspired video, she is a secretary who is caught in a love affair with her married boss (played by Brandon Routh). A co-writer of the song, she is also the genius behind the video. “She actually reached out to us and said, ‘I’ve got a great idea for the video,’ and she wrote the treatment”, Sugarland’s Jennifer Nettles told People.
