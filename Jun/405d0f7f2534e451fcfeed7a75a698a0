 Small doctor  Former Director of New Media for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Deji Adeyanju, had taken to Twitter to claim that President Buhari gave some entertainers N2million each when they visited him during the Ramadan fast. “So, some youths went to Aso Rock yesterday to see Buhari and collected ‘thanks for coming’ N2m each. Very soon, they will start telling us why it is good for Buhari to continue.” According to the Penalty crooner, “I am not aware the President gave anyone N2m. I was only invited to Aso Rock during the Ramadan period, which I honoured. Have you asked Sound Sultan or Kunle Afolayan and they said Buhari gave us N2m each. Well, I don’t know if they gave anyone but I didn’t collect such money,” he stated. “I have always worked hard and my hard work is paying off. I felt humbled and privileged meeting Mr. President. Looking at where I used to be, there has been a major turn around in my life. Do you remember I was once a bus conductor?” he added. The ‘Mosquito killer’ emphasised that the invitation was a dream come true for him. He noted that all the celebrities who visited the State House are of the Muslim faith; hence there were no favourite celebrities in attendance. Notable among the celebrities are Tobi Bakre of BBNaija Season 3, Small Doctor, Sound Sultan and Kunle Afolayan.
