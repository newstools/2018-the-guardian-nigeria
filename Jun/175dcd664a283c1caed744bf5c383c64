As part of activities celebrating its 10th anniversary and also supporting Super Eagles campaign at Russia World Cup, which ended on Tuesday after the loss to Argentina, VIP Express Tourism Limited, a tourist company, hosted a competition and gave away holiday packages. The company asked members to post their VIP holiday pictures on their social media pages using the hastag||myvipholiday and see how many likes they could get. The couple with the highest number of likes emerge winners. The second leg of the contest, which began on June 1, requires members to predict correctly match scores and also win attractive prizes.The winning couple for the competition, Mr. and Mrs. Oladimeji Onabajo, received a total of 4,127 likes and emerged winners of a single return ticket to Russia, but they chose the alternative prize money of N500,000 equivalent of the ticket money. The Onabajos, who couldn’t contain their joy, said, “We were not too keen because I am not usually lucky with such things and I knew many people entered for the same competition and any other could have won but my wife encouraged me that we should enter for it and we did. I also remember that at one of VIP’s giveaways, people won cars; so, I was encouraged and here we are.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
