Happy couples and relationship enthusiasts say the formula for keeping a relationship strong include: spending time together, listening to each other, being there for each other. While these rituals are, of course, important and worthwhile, other underestimated things can also keep your relationship healthy. Going on Exercise Dates Exercising with your partner gives more time to be with each other while meeting each otherâ€™s health and fitness goals. The thought of impressing your partner would definitely help you avoid lazing around while working out! Ditch Your Phones Rather than scrolling through Twitter or liking your friends photos on Instagram, keep your phones away and find an activity to do together or spark up a conversation. You can play a game, go for a walk, or just talk, but the important thing is that you are using the time for your phones to spend time together. Do Home chores together You do not necessarily have to fold laundry, but pick a household chore that you can work on together. Maybe you can wash the dishes together, or do some work in the garden together. Whatever the task, focus on accomplishing it together. Try Something New Together Participating in a new activity together can keep the relationship exciting. Take a cooking class, volunteer at a charity organization, or take dance lessons together. A willingness to learn something new can help you grow together as a couple. Spend Time with Other Couples Spending time with couples who have healthy relationships can be good for you. Look for couples who share your interest and have a strong relationship. It can help remind you to keep the relationship exciting. ad unit=2
