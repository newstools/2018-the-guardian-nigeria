The feat is undertaken in association with United Kingdom’s largest gold producers. Despite the extremely high price tag, the firm said interest is likely to be strong since all five will be available on a strictly first-come-first-served basis. The Guardian learnt that only five people in the world will ever own one of these hypnotic, stress-busting items, and it is expected that they will be snapped up by either Russian, Middle Eastern or Chinese buyers. But the firm is wooing businesses in Nigeria on the ground that no-one should underestimate the buying power of Nigeria, where most of Africa’s super-wealthy individuals come from. “Nigerians have a historic eye for gold, and a reputation for moving fast and decisively when opportunity presents itself,” the firm stated. In this venture, Aurumsphera is collaborating with Baird & Co of London who are the UK’s largest gold refiners, and with the Edinburgh Assay Company, who have been authenticating and hallmarking precious metals.
