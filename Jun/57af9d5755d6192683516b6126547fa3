Step 2: Cut to fit Right down the centre, cut the lash band to provide a larger individual lash. This makes it is easier to apply than a full lash strip which could turn out weird or crooked. Step 3: Apply Adhesives Gently trace each lash band, one by one with a thin line of lash glue, then wait a few moments for it to dry. Step 4: Put on your lashes With your fingers,Â place your extension on the outer corner first, hugging that lash line tight or you can also place the outer extension slightly above the natural lashline for an eye-lifting effect. While placing the inner lashes, avoid going close to the tear duct to give a little bit more width to the eye.
