Country Director of the project, Dr. Hussaini Abdu, who spoke on â€œEnvironmental conflicts and the quest for national identity, blamed degradation for the nefarious activities of the Boko Haram insurgents. According to him, it was also responsible for the recurring conflicts between farmers and herdsmen, as well as the activities of militants in the Niger Delta region. He said rather than exploring avenues of tackling the environmental issues involved, Nigerians are reading ethnic and regional perspectives into it. He canvassed rotational presidency among the six geopolitical zones in the country.
