Stuart Symington.The advice, at the Financial Times (FT) Nigeria Summit, in Lagos, yesterday, came after some Nigerians expressed disappointment over President Muhammadu Buhari’s Democracy Day speech, where he listed his achievements.
  
Symington noted that the country’s leadership could maintain stability through its dealings with the citizens. According to him, the best security Nigeria could afford is providing jobs, education and ensuring justice for all. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who was also at the event titled, “Dispelling Uncertainty and Building Resilience”, told the investing community that the country’s economy has overcome uncertainty, citing 15-month falling inflation, global ranking on ease of business and external reserves at over $47 billion. Persons underestimating the country’s current revenue profile are living in the past, as the debt-to-revenue ratio is now 34 per cent, against 66 per cent, he said. He also disclosed that a lot of work and consultations are ongoing with regard to government’s stake in joint venture businesses and privatisation of assets.
