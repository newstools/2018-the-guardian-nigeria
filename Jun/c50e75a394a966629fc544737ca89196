I am unashamedly a huge fan of cotton candy. It is soft, pink and delicious. That makes it the perfect ingredient for a Sunday Funday (or any other day, to be honest) brunch. This cotton candy margarita is inspired by the popular candy that made our childhood, using it to create a perfectly-mixed pink cocktail. The tasty dessert drink mixes up pink cotton candy with tequila, orange-flavoured liqueur, lime juice and cream soda. Plus, it gives a little show when you pour the booze over the cotton candy. *Recipe makes one cocktail. Cotton Candy Margarita. Photo: MomTrends Cotton Candy Margarita. Photo: Pinterest
