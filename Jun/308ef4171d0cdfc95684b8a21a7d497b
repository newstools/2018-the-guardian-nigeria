After all the drama with Kanye West over the past month, the rapper finally dropped his new album, titled “Ye”. The rapper hosted a bunch of journalists and DJs for a listening party in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Thursday where he live-streamed his new album Ye for fans. And of course, Kim who tweeted backstage saying; Kanye took the photo that serves as Ye’s album cover on the way to the party.   And before you ask ‘Yes’ he referenced Tristian’s cheating and his remark on ‘slavery being a choice’ in these lines: In the third track, “All Mine,” West raps “All these THOTS on Christian Mingle … That’s what almost got Tristan single.” And just as you might expect, Twitterattis have reacted:    Kanye also referenced his controversial slavery comments. Kim K obviously thought the comment would make them lose a lot of quids. Ye probably thought so too and he gave his wife the opportunity to bail out on him before the trouble comes calling. He raps on of the tracks: “Wife calling screaming saying we’re about to lose it all, I had to calm her down ’cause she couldn’t breathe, I told her she could leave me now but she wouldn’t leave.” Well…it turns out Kanye is still standing. How tall? You can guess.
