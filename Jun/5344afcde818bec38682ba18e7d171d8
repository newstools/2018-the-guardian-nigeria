Another member of the royal family is about to have a royal wedding more historic than the first one this summer. First, Meghan Markle was the first mix-raced woman to officially join the royal family, we had Bishop Michael Curry stealing the show with his next level speech, a gospel choir singing ‘Stand By Me’ and Harry’s ex-girlfriend showing up. It was great. Now Lord Ivar Mountbatten (Queen Elizabeth’s cousin) will be the first gay royal family member to marry his partner. Lord Mountbatten came out in 2016, being the first to do so in the royal wedding, and announced that he was in a relationship with James Coyle. He was previously married to a woman named Penny and they share three daughters. Penny his ex-wife will be walking him down the aisle, “It was the girls’ idea,” she said of the new wedding details. “It makes me feel quite emotional. I’m really very touched.” Lord Mountbatten says he’s doing this for his partner, “For me, what’s interesting is I don’t need to get married because I’ve been there, done that and have my wonderful children; but I’m pushing it because I think it’s important for him,” Lord Mountbatten said. “James hasn’t had the stable life I have. I want to be able to give you that.” As for the plans for the big day, James revealed that the ceremony, taking place in the private chapel on Lord Mountbatten’s estate in Devon, will be small and intimate, with just close friends and family in attendance followed by a bigger reception of 120 guests. And while there will not be traditional wedding components such as a first dance, white doves or a wedding cake, there will be cheese, according to the pair.
