He said as Christians, created with the sole purpose of serving God, the main focus must be to unite and live as one regardless of the denomination and making Jesus uppermost in whatever they do.
 
Managing Director, 141 Worldwide Limited, Lampe Omoyele, who reviewed the book said it reveals the challenges facing the Christian faith and provides solutions to addressing the issues. Omoyele also said the book presents the basis for self-examination in the light of the scriptures and taking the gospel to the nations of the world as witnesses before the end of the world.
  
While delivering his keynote address ‘The Church: God’s New Direction,’ Provost of Grace Springs Bible College, Ilupeju, Lagos, Dr. Ebenezer Kayode, who also edited the book, said Christians misunderstand the church, adding that lack of same vision has led to the division in the church. While recommending the book to Christians, Kayode, however, said the church must come together and realise its goal on earth, which is to unite as one under Christ regardless of denominations. He added that God wants to use Christians and the church to bring his promises to pass among the nations of the earth.
