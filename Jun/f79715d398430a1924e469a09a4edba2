It was a distressing moment in Nigeria as they played against Argentina. Full of hope and leaving their fate in the hands of the Super Eagles and the cat and pig, Nigerians were fearless before the match boasting to their rivals of a flawless victory. A draw was all they needed and the Super Eagles would hopefully soar to victory. But that was not going to happen. Leaving the giant of Africa to clean their open wound that was only starting to close, the Super Eagles were treated to a show of disappointment as the G.O.A.T-led team humbled the Eagles on the pitch. See reactions of Nigerians and place your hands on your chest while at it:         Argentina qualifying is so undeserved and I feel so sorry for Nigeria  #NGAARG — Tom  (@MangosteenESC) June 26, 2018    What did Nigeria say to the #WorldCup? #NGAARG Nigeria: pic.twitter.com/5YGnhae8vv — ♔ King Absolute ♔ (@KingAbsolute_) June 26, 2018  Nigeria proved to the Whole World that they don’t go down without a fight.
