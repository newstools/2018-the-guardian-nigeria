To put smiles on the faces of the less-privileged, widows and orphans, the All-Believer Christian Fellowship, Ladipo Market, in conjunction with all Ladipo warehouses and car parks in Lagos at the weekend extended its helping hand to orphans, widows, and physically challenged persons in their neighbourhoods. Coordinator of the fellowship, Pastor Brown C. Ohams, said it was part of their responsibilities as believers, to always assist the less privileged. He promised that subsequent ones would be better. The guest minister, Pastor Joseph Sunuola, urged everyone to always provide for children and the needy, as “it is a way of reciprocating God’s love.”  He was grateful to those who contributed to the success of the programme. The organisation also hosted the physically-challenged persons from the family vocational institute in Ijoko, Ogun State. Sunuola commended the organisers for giving assistance to the less-privileged kids in the community they do business. Items donated included cartons of noodles, bags of rice, cartons of biscuits, drinks, diapers and other relief materials. Also, over 200 widows from different local governments in Lagos were recently provided medical care and drugs by Human Development Initiatives (HDI).After checking their weight, height, blood pressure and sugar levels, they were attended to by one of the four doctors who interacted with them to listen to their complaint. Thereafter, the doctors would give advice and prescribe drugs, which were dispensed by pharmacists.
 
Before then, the doctors gave general health talks and took turns to respond and clarify questions asked by the participants. The doctors explained the importance of eating healthy, exercise and food to stay away from, aside not eating late.
 
Executive Director of HDI, Mrs. Olufunke Owasanoye, said the healthcare and screening for widows by her organisation is an annual event which provides support for widows.According to her, widows after the loss of their husbands usually suffer depression, which could complicate their health. Owasanoye noted that some of the widows might also be having health challenges, which they may not disclose or not be able to go to the clinic for care because of fund.One of the participants, Mrs. Taibat Sanni, commended HDI for organising the event. She said it was not the first time she was participating and it has been highly beneficial to her.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
