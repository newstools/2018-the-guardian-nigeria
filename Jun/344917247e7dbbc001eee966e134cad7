Carl Ikeme Carl Ikeme has revealed his cancer is in complete remission. Ikeme in a post on Twitter made the announcement a day after the Super Eagles defated Iceland. The 32 year old had been diagnosed with acute Leukemia when he returned abnormal blood results during pre-season in July 2017. Ikeme tweeted; “After a year of intense chemotherapy I would like to share that I am in complete REMISSION. “I still have hurdles to pass to be cured,but hopefully I can move on with some normality! “I would like to thank everyone for there support over the past year. Thank you.”  Ikeme was regarded as the 24th player on the Super Eagles team by Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr. He also stated that his greatest regret was that Ikeme was not with the side. The Icelandic National team also gave a touching tribute to the Wolves goalkeeper with their team holding a shirt with Ikeme’s name on it in a photo. In a similar post and lengthier post on Instagram, the goalkeeper thanked his club and Nigeria for their support. He said he was unsure of what was next but he is taking it a day at a time. After a tough year and intense chemotherapy throughout I would like to let everyone know I am in complete REMISSION . I still have hurdles to get over to be cured but I can hopefully now move forward with some normality. I would like to thank my family/friends to start with who have gone above and beyond for me  The support I have received from Wolves/Nigeria, the football world and from people from all over the world has been hard to put into words.
