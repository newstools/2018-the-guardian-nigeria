 Makarfi  Makarfi, who was also former Chairman, Caretaker Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), stated this yesterday in his Eid-el-Fitr message to Islamic faithful to mark the end of Ramadan fasting. He urged Muslims and Nigerians not to lose sight of the lessons of spiritual rejuvenation, sacrifice and self-deprivation, as some of the fundamental components of the exercise. In a statement by his media assistant, Mukthar Sirajo, he pointed out that there was an urgent need to put an end to the crisis that had held the nation down for so long. In a related development, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) charged Muslims to embrace the lessons of Ramadan, even as it beseeched Nigerians to be patriotic and allow religious tolerance in all their dealings. TUC President, Comrade Bobboi Bala Kaigama and Secretary General, Comrade Musa-Lawal Ozidi, said the deficiency of the virtues of Ramadan was responsible for why countries with which Nigeria was at par in the 1970s had left us behind. The labour leaders noted that it was time to look beyond all artificial, socio- political and economic divisions, including ethnic and religious differences in the country. Meanwhile, the Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association (DAPPMA) yesterday assured of 24-hour products availability and loading to filling stations nationwide during the holidays. Executive Secretary of DAPPMA, Olufemi Adewole, gave the assurance in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Adewole assured of the  associationâ€™s readiness to ensure massive loading at various private depots across the country.
