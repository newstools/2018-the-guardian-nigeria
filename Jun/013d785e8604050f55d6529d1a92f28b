The midfielder, who picked up the injury in Saturday’s shock 2-1 defeat to Austria, has not taken part in full training over the last four days at Germany’s pre-World Cup camp in Eppan, north Italy. “It’s nothing dramatic, we just don’t want to take any risk and he was able to sprint in training. I assume he will be okay for the World Cup,” said Germany’s team director Oliver Bierhoff. Ozil, who finished the 2017/18 season with a back injury, faces a race to get his knee ready for Germany’s first World Cup game against Mexico in Moscow on June 17 having also drawn South Korea and Sweden in Group F.
