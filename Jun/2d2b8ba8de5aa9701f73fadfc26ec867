Jaw dropping secrets and transformations were the peaks of our week. With each day came shocking stories that will change our impression of certain events for a long time to come. These are the stories that made our week… It has been a season of diss tracks in the rap game and Pusha T is ready for it. After Drake dropped his Duppy Freestyle in response to T’s Daytona, Pusha T’s latest reveal The Story of Adidon became disrespectfully revealing. He exposed Drake as a deadbeat dad “You are hiding a child” and while advising him to “let that boy come home”. He also revealed that the baby mama is Sophie Brussaux, a nude video model. This is turning out to be another Tupac and BIG resurrection. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-649989 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-1062x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response-600x338.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drake-pusha-t-story-of-adidon-response.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Snoop Dogg is winning in all angles.
