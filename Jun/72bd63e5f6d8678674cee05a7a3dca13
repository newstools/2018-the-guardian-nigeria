G-Worldwide Entertainment may have been silent for a while but they are not backing down in the battle against former signee Kizz Daniel, formerly known as Kiss Daniel. The Woju singer has been in a court battle with the record label over an alleged breach of contract since he announced his departure from the label and set up his own named Flyboy Inc. Kizz Daniel. Photo: Naija News Agency Although the name change, according to the label, has no effect on the ongoing court case, they have filed an application for the trademark of the new name, Kizz Daniel. A document granting the trademark was shared on Twitter by A&R Gbemi Ereku. Dated June 12, 2018, the application was made on June 6, 2018.  <img class="aligncenter wp-image-662329 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trademark-Kiizz-Daniel-e1529089907916.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1538" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trademark-Kiizz-Daniel-e1529089907916.jpg 575w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trademark-Kiizz-Daniel-e1529089907916-498x598.jpg 498w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trademark-Kiizz-Daniel-e1529089907916-463x557.jpg 463w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trademark-Kiizz-Daniel-e1529089907916-200x240.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trademark-Kiizz-Daniel-e1529089907916-399x480.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trademark-Kiizz-Daniel-e1529089907916-499x600.jpg 499w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> A statement released by the record label revealed that the use of either of the names, Kiss Daniel and Kizz Daniel amount to a breach of intellectual property rights. See excerpts from the statement below as seen on Pulse: “The Management of G-Worldwide Entertainment wishes to inform the general public that the matter of G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd v Oluwatobiloba Daniel Anidugbe before the Federal High Court, Lagos Division, is still ongoing contrary to the fake news being peddled by the artiste and his advisers to mislead the public. Following several requests and enquiries by Nigerian and foreign online media and entertainment outfits about the status of the matter, it has become needful to notify the public of the current state of facts. The suit at the Federal High Court last came up on 16th May 2018 whereupon our lawyers informed the Judge of a pending application for status quo to further restrain the rebellious acts of the artiste in view of the recent release of previously unreleased songs from the Evolution album, as well as the continued use of the name Kiss Daniel without our approval… It also interesting to inform the public that the Court was informed about the artiste’s release of the new song titled 4 Dayz, and For You a collaboration with WizKid, which are songs from the Evolution album, the ownership of which forms the subject matter of the suit at Federal High Court. We, therefore, need to let the public know that these releases demonstrate that the artiste is on a trip to put the credibility of other artistes whom he collaborates with in question. We are also aware that the artiste has released the video of 4 Days, done a collaboration with Sheyi Shay titled Surrender, and another song, Me ke with Omawumi by changing his name from ’Kiss Daniel’ to ‘‘Kizz Daniel’’. Let the whole world also take note that G-Worldwide is also the owner of the name ‘‘Kizz Daniel’’ (see acceptance and acknowledgement documents from the Ministry of Trade & Investment). All digital platforms have been put on notice for take down of infringing materials where the name Kizz Daniel is in use, and we have responded to foreign and local media outfits on this issue following calls for clarification. We also wish to formally inform the public that the artiste’s use of the names Kiss Daniel and Kizz Daniel amount to breach of the company’s intellectual property rights. Thank you.”
