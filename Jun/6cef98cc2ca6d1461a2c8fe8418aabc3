Another day, another Kanye rip. Popular Instagram account @diet_prada, who calls out copycats in fashion, accused West of ripping off photos for his Yeezy Season 6 lookbook, From a 2015 series by photographer Rita Minissi. It’s pretty messed up when you consider the original work by Rita Minissi explores identity and was inspired by dealing with personal trauma and a resulting desire to reconnect with her own body. The rapper has been called out for plagiarising work for his Yeezy label in the past and even fired a person from his design team after they presented work from Nike designer Tony Spackman as their own. West hasn’t been shy about taking direct inspiration for his art.
