Britain has warned of possible attacks on its territory by battle-hardened extremists sneaked into Nigeria from Syria by leaders of terrorist group, Islamic State (IS). According to a report by the UK SUN yesterday, fanatics, including Boko Haram insurgents, were also being sent to the Middle East for training in what it described as exchange programme. The report said there were fears that strong links between Nigeria and the UK would make it easier for IS to send its killers to Britain to orchestrate terror attacks, death and destruction. It noted that more than 150 British troops are conducting counter-terror training with Nigerian forces in an attempt to stem the bloody tide and stop IS from taking hold in the West African region.At one training mission in Kaduna, a senior Nigerian Air Force commander revealed how local jihadi groups were learning from IS after swearing allegiance to its black flag. Group Captain, Isaac Subi, 46, who has been fighting terrorism across Africa since 1991, said IS had an exchange programme of fighters.â€œThey come and train their fighters here and some of our insurgents too are granted access to their training in Yemen and Syria, acquiring those skills and they come back and teach others.The report further stated that the poisonous influence of the fighters had already ended in horror attacks on British streets, citing the stabbing to death of Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013 in London by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, both of Nigerian descent.
