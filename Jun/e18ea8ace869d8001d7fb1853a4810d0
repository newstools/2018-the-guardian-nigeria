Legendary singer, Mariah Carey, had two months ago revealed she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 17 years ago. In an interview with The Guardian International edition, Carey shared details on her childhood struggles with being biracial. Carey, whose mother is Irish-American was disowned by her family for getting married to an African-American. During the interview, she recalled a time when one of her friends saw her father, Alfred Carey, for the first time. “She burst into tears because she had never seen a black person. I just remember how that impacted on me”, she said. Her parents, however, got divorced when she was three. The divorce and the struggle to survive had a disastrous impact on her.
