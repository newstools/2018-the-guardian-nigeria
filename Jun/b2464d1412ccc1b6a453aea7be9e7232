The Mega Party’s candidate stressed that election is about fighting for the future and liberating the people from retrogression.He urged Ekiti people to vote for a man who would plan for their future through qualitative education, good healthcare services and provision of employment.Omoyeni said his party is focused on reviving Ekiti State across all sectors, adding that the welfare of the people would remain his priorities. He condemned the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for wasting the resources of the state on white elephant projects, when workers and pensioners had not been paid.He said: “We have a governor who has refused to take advantage of the various Federal Government initiatives that should have alleviated the poor socio-economic conditions of the people. “I want our people to vote for me and my party so that they can benefit from various development funds created by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the Bank of Industry (BoI)”
Omoyeni had also reiterated his message to worshippers at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Life Fountain Cathedral, where he charged them to vote for him as the best among those seeking their votes. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
