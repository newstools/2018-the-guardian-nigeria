Iceland’s coach Heimir Hallgrimsson applauds after being defeated by Nigeria at the end of the Russia 2018 World Cup Group D football match between Nigeria and Iceland at the Volgograd Arena in Volgograd on June 22, 2018. NICOLAS ASFOURI / AFP Iceland coach, Heimar Hallgrimsson, still believes his team can qualify for the second round of the on-going FIFA World Cup in Russia despite its 0-2 loss to Nigeria yesterday. Hallgrimsson told the media immediately after the game that his team would go back to work on the game against Croatia with the hope of beating the Group D leaders to enhance their chances of survival in the group thrown open by Nigeria’s 2-0 victory yesterday. Despite the impeccable form of the Croats, the coach said Iceland would be up the task, as he knows what to expect from Luka Modric’s teammates. “We have met Croatian four times in the last four years and it has always been special. We know what kind of game it would be, and we will be prepared for whatever team they bring against us,” he said. On yesterday’s loss to Nigeria, Halllgrimsson said his team was disheveled by Nigeria’s early second half goal, adding, however, “I thought every one did his best. Nigeria played very well and were difficult to beat. The weather also worked against us.” He praised his players for giving everything they had to the game, adding that he would look at the fitness of his players and plan for a better outing on Tuesday. “We were ready for this game and the players did well in the first half. Their goal meant we had to chase the game and they punished us. “We expected Nigeria to be dangerous. We expected their changed formation, which they played well.
