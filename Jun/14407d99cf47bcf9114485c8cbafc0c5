Bandits suspected to be herdsmen have again invaded Kuriga village, along Birnin Gwari road in Chikun local council area yesterday, killing five people and injuring many. As at yesterday night, the numbers casualties of the attack were said to have risen but there has been no accurate figure given by the police yet. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mukthar Aliyu promised to call The Guardian back for confirmation of the attack and casualty figures, but did not respond as at when this story was going to print. The attack, which occurred yesterday, barely a week after search for arms operation at Kuriga village by security operatives, happened around 2.05pm, when the Muslim Juma’at service was halfway, as the bandits shot sporadically at the worshippers and engaged in house-to-house operations unchallenged. A resident of Kuriga who escaped the onslaught, Mallam Musa said, “We were attacked by armed bandits, just one week after some people in uniform come around 1.00am in search of arms. We suspect foul play in this attack”. The attacks, like many others around Birnin-Gwari axis continued without any attempts by the security personnel to repel the attacks, he said. However, the vigilantes from neighbouring Udawa and Birnin-Gwari succeeded in repelling the attacks after a while but the bandits succeeded in carting away 89 cows from the village. Kuriga village is in Chikun Local council area, along the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari highway. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
