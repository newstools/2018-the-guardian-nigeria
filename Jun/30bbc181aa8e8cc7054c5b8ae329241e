Former Super Eagles player, Henry Nwosu, has said the country’s senior national team suffered defeat in the hands of Argentina at the ongoing 2018 World Cup, because of complacency in the team’s defence and attack. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Nwosu, who was shocked by Super Eagles’ ouster from the tourney, stated that the team should have taken all its chances in the game and allow Argentina to be under pressure. He commended the Eagles for putting up a good fight against the Argentine team, saying that the result of the match is a big lesson for Nigeria to prepare well for subsequent international engagements. The ex-U17 manager also pleaded with football loving Nigerians not to write off the Eagles yet, adding that the players still have much to offer the country in future. “I’m not happy over the defeat. We could have beaten Argentina, because they were careless with the ball when it mattered most. Assuming Ighalo took the chances he had in front of keeper, there would have been no room for argument. This is why the referee was not happy with the team towards the end of the game. Eagles should take this as a lesson in future, they should use any little every opportunity given to them and avoid challenging the referee, “ he said. “Argentina used their chance when it mattered most by scoring the first goal through Lionel Messi in the first half. They also took their chance by scoring a vital goal at the last minute of the encounter based on mistake in the Eagles defence line. The Eagles played well but could not convert their chances like the Argentines,” Nwosu added.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
