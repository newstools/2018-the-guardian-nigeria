We know a little about the tracklist-in-progress and the listening party set to be held in LA this Friday. However, the album artwork has been revealed. We also know that it will be released with a short film by Dexter Navy. Kid Cudi took to Twitter last night to share the cover, designed by Takashi Murakami.  Teased a few months back, the cover is designed by iconic Japanese artist Takashi Murakami and offers a look into the tone of the album. Recalling the colour palette he used on Kanye’s Graduation album, Murakami referenced Japanese folklore and traditional ukiyo-e woodblock printing with his signature Superflat character styling.
