Alli seemed to be struggling towards the end of the first half in Volgograd but stayed on until the 80th minute, when he was replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Harry Kane’s late winner secured England a 2-1 opening victory in Group G and Alli looked dangerous, particularly during an excellent early spell for Gareth Southgate’s side. The 22-year-old has six days to recover before Sunday’s game against Panama, with Marcus Rashford and Loftus-Cheek both potential replacements. “We had to keep monitoring Dele,” Southgate said after the match on Monday. “He was feeling a little bit of an issue just before half-time but felt he could carry on and I thought the runs that he was making and the way he was pressing the ball was still causing a problem.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
