Video footage showed the puppy being treated by a vet, but it could not be saved. Turkish prosecutors have launched a “thorough investigation”. Lutfi Dursun, chief public prosecutor in Sakarya, said a digger operator known to have been working in the region was detained, the official Anadolu news agency reported. Sakarya governor Irfan Balkanlioglu said the circumstances of the mutilation were not yet clear. “Our initial findings show a construction vehicle may have chopped off the dog’s paws,” he was quoted as saying in Turkish media. He insisted the authorities would do whatever was necessary to determine if any negligence had been shown.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
