Whether the space is dedicated to simple domestic administration, hobbies or your real job, setting up a comfortable, practical working area is one of the best investments you can make whatever the size of your home. We have put together some workspaces to inspire you in case you find yourself in this category. Most of these designs can be bought in large furniture companies or made by a competent, skilled cabinet-maker. Up-cycled furniture Painted grey, a simple desk with an armchair looks elegant in the corner of a living room. Source a vintage desk or old desk and re-paint it, or source an upcycled, ready-painted desk from a furniture company. Under the stairs With careful planning, the angular space under a staircase can become a tidy, flexible home-office area. Ensure adequate head-room above the chair, and maximise storage by fitting full-height cupboards in the taller space. Good lighting from angled spots, or wall lights makes all the difference. Creative Corner Instead of trying to hide a desk in a corner, make it an important feature of the space. In contrast to the smooth grey-painted paneling, a solid desk with distressed finish is ideal for creating a rustic effect. A s well as deep drawers, open shelves beneath the desktop mean books and files are within easy reach and not an inch of corner space is wasted. Hobby Space When planning furniture for a sewing room or similar craft area, think outside the box, as a desk is only one solution. It is really important to take a step back, feel the space and its size and think practically about what you need in the room. Decide how you want to use the piece, a console table that doubles as a desk could be just right for you. Prime Position Extend your workspace by placing a desk in front of built-in shelving for both extra storage and clear surface space. Sitting comfortably is also a must. A good chair should be supportive of your body, allowing for easy movement. The longer you’re using the chair daily, the more features you should consider, such as back support, seat height and tilt adjustments. If more than one person will be using the chair, look for one that has dynamic adjustment and integrated lumbar support. Career Ladder Leaning lightly against the wall and secured by fixings through a pigeonhole section, a mango wood ladder-style desk saves space and looks great. It instantly creates an unfussy home office and the simple styling and natural materials are ideal for creating a casual country look that’s both functional and beautiful. Glass Top Your home-working environment should offer the same level of elegance, comfort and practicality as the rest of the house. A great way to ensure functionality and style is to team a sleek, contemporary glass-topped desk with a cupboard-style workstation, that way you can tidy your computer and paperwork behind closed doors – perfect if your home office is part of another room. Empire Building To “own” your workspace in the true sense, ensure all the items you need are stored within arm’s reach. This desk should combine traditional good looks and generous space to work. This kind of design provides plenty of storage in pedestals on either side, which offers space for hanging files behind disguised double-depth drawers. To personalise your office, hang a noticeboard above the desk, made up in purchased fabric or one you’ve done yourself.
