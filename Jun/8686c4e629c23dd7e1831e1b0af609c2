She noted that the Buhari’s administration has recorded incompetence in the security sector which has resulted to the incessant killings across the nation.  ‘The president should stop rewarding incompetence in the fact that security establishments and systems have not prevented the deaths we have been recording in this country as a result of terrorist herdsmen’ She further emphasized that ‘it’s an abomination for the president to acknowledge the killings of many innocent citizen as retaliatory’ The Inspector-General of Police (I-G), , Mr Ibrahim Idris, had however , deployed Special Intervention Force to Plateau to restore peace in Barkin-Ladi, Riyom, Jos South local government areas and other flash points in the state.
