Lagos state Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode Wednesday lauded the declaration of June 12 as the New Democracy Day by President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Habib Aruna, Ambode said the development was a historic and commends Buhari for the declaration. “This is a welcome development. It is a historic moment in our nation, and I join other Nigerians to commend President Buhari on this announcement. “By this move, he has done what previous administrations failed to do. “This not only shows that the president is a man of history and character but also eloquently confirms that the heroes of democracy did not die in vain after all.” Buhari had on Wednesday declared June 12 be celebrated as Democracy Day in honour of the late presumed winner of the June 12 1993 Presidential Election, Chief MKO Abiola. Meanwhile, The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said: “It is a sign of political desperation for President Buhari to seek to use Chief Abiola’s name as a tool to sway Nigerians in less than 12 months to an election where he (Buhari) is seeking a second term.” “If President Buhari genuinely wants to honour Chief Abiola, he should do so by ending all anti-democratic proclivities of his administration and allow for the rule of law and respect for our constitution. “The PDP, therefore, urges President Buhari to shed his desperate actions in his quest to win the 2019 presidential election, as Nigerians can no longer be deceived by such antics.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
