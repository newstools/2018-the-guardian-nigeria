Wizkid first graced our television screens and caught the attention of ladies when he featured in Banky W’s Lagos Party in 2009. On this day, seven years ago, he took the Nigerian music industry by storm his looks, his swag, his style and his hits with his album Superstar album under the Banky W owned Empire Mates Entertainment (EME). With songs such as Love My Baby, Pakuromo and Tease Me, Superstar got him seven nominations and four wins. Gaining recognition from the likes of Wizkid and Rihanna, Wizkid is, arguably, Nigeria’s biggest music export. To celebrate the seventh year anniversary of the album that made him a Superstar, we have compiled seven of our favourites tracks. Enjoy!
