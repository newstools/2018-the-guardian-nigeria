Bloating is the condition of your belly feeling swollen after eating. “Bloating” is not the same as water retention, but the two terms are often used interchangeably. There is nothing fun about bloating; many times, it comes with unbearable pain. Below are a few ways to reduce or eliminate bloating: It is advisable to eat smaller portions, to give your digestive tract a chance to work. If small food makes you hungry and weak, then it is best to eat healthy while overeating. Rather than having one heavy meal for lunch, split it into two healthy meals. It is best not to drink water with your food. Rather, drink water at least an hour later. It dilutes your stomach acid, making it harder for your stomach to break down the food which will then sit in your gut for much longer and produce gas. Drinking huge amounts of water in one sitting (around one litre), especially cold water, stretches your stomach and can lead to bloating. This could mean climbing stairs twice a week during your lunch break or going for an evening walk for an hour. Whatever it is, putting 15 to 20 minutes each day into any exercise activity will help you fight constipation and keep things moving smoothly through your digestive tract. That also helps in avoiding bloating. Turmeric is a detoxifying spice. People buy it in powder form, but you can also get drops of turmeric, and add a teaspoon (in either form) to water, tea, juice, or any drink before an event, to avoid bloating. It is advisable to avoid eating dinner late at night to avoid waking up to a puffed-out stomach. Eating early gives the food time to digest before you rest.
