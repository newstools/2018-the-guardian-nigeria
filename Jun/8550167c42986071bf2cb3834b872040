He said the “multiple air strike operation” followed intelligence report on the presence of terrorists in some locations in the state. He said many terrorists were on Friday successfully neutralised. “The ATF detailed two NAF Alpha Jet aircraft, armed with rockets and cannons, to interdict the locations. Overhead the objective, the NAF fighter aircraft acquired and attacked the objectives with rockets and cannons. “At the end of the mission, it was observed that the attack platforms successfully engaged the remnants of the terrorists hibernating within the settlements and consequently neutralised them.” Meanwhile, troops of Operation Last Hold in the state said it rid farmlands and the Lake Chad Islands of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
