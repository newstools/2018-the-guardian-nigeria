The six emirs that migrated to neighbouring states also returned to Maiduguri, the state capital, before moving to their rebuilt palaces in Bama, Gwoza, Dikwa and Askira. El-Kanemi disclosed this last Friday, when he paid a Sallah visit to Governor Kashim Shettima at Government House in Maiduguri. The Shehu of Borno, who noted that peace has returned after nine years of the insurgency in the state, said: “Your Excellency, the Governor of Borno State, I want to take this opportunity to clearly state that no single local government area is under the control of Boko Haram insurgents. “The four council areas of Abadam, Kala/Balge, Guzamala and Marte in Borno Emirate Council, which were inaccessible, last year, have been liberated by the military.” He said that most of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in camps have also returned to the liberated council areas in northern Borno. He lamented that during the insurgency, several district and ward heads were killed, including some of his relations at the Maiduguri palace. He, however, thanked the governor for services rendered to his people. Responding, Shettima thanked the monarch for his “sacrifices and steadfastness” throughout the period. To attend the needs of the victims, the governor said 15 mega schools are about to be completed in Maiduguri metropolis, adding that the current population of widows and orphans from the crisis is 54,900 and 52,311.
