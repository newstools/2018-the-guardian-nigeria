Speaking at a business summit to launch the platform in Lagos, Chief Executive Officer, Vconnect, Deepankar Rustagi, said the company is poised to solve the issue of finding a reliable service provider in the industry. Hence, it has created a way of ensuring trust between service professionals and customers on the platform with providing national identity documents and taking a pledge to provide quality services.
