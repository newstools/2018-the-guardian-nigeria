Former Kebbi State Governor, Alhaji Saidu Usman Dakingari, has finally been served with a 15-count charge by a bailiff of the Federal High Court, Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi , after evading operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for over one month. The 15-count charge was served on the former governor yesterday at his residence at GRA, Birnin Kebbi, through one of his household, Mohammed Danladi, who collected the charge and the court order issued by the court granting the complainant leave to serve Dakingari alongside the second and third defendants. Dakingari was supposed to be arraigned on June 20, 2018 before the Federal High Court, Kebbi, alongside three others,  Sunday Dogonyaro, Abdullahi Yelwa and Garba Rabiu Kamba, for allegedly receiving N700 million from the former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke. The arraignment was, however, stalled because the first, second and third defendants evaded service and refused to honour invitation by the EFCC.Consequently, the prosecution was only able to produce the fourth defendant, Garba Rabiu Kamba in the court. However, Johnson Ojogbane applied for an order of court to grant the prosecution leave to serve the defendants through either their counsel, sureties, an adult member of their household or on their last known addresses.The application was granted as prayed and the matter was subsequently adjourned to June 25, 2018 for arraignment.
