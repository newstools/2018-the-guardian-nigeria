 NADECO chieftain,  Dr. Amos Akingba  He maintained that the bad system of governance is responsible for the situation the country is facing adding, “Virtually most citizens are criminally minded because of the bad system of governance. When you go to other African countries, they call Nigeria big for nothing. When you say you are a Nigerian they laugh at us that a country that have all the mineral resources in the world, a country that has vast arable land to grow all manner of things, still smuggle things into the country. It is a big shame and I don’t see how we can laugh about it. We have to face the truth tactically.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
