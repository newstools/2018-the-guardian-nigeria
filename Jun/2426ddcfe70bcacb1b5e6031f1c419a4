Obama’s comments joined a firestorm of opposition to the Donald Trump administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” policy begun in early May that caused the separation of more than 2,300 children from their parents after they crossed the US-Mexico border illegally. Acknowledging the overwhelming criticism, President Trump said at the White House that he would sign an order to keep migrant families together, despite for days insisting that only a new law passed by Congress could halt the separations. Trump’s decision came after sustained bipartisan criticism, including from former first ladies who spoke out Monday. Michelle Obama said simply, “Sometimes truth transcends party,” while retweeting an excerpt of a newspaper op-ed by Laura Bush. Bush wrote in the Washington Post: “I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.” She also compared the family separations to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, considered one of the darkest chapters of American history.
