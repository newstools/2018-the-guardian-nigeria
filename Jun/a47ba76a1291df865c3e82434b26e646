All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Candidate, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, with former minister of State for Works, Prince Dayo Adeyeye and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), in a street procession during a welcome reception for Fayemi in Ado – Ekiti… on Friday. •Secondus accuses APC of turning state into war zone
The campaign organisation of the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prof. Kolapo Olusola, has cautioned Rotimi Akeredolu against selling a failed ex-governor to Ekiti State. The party urged Akeredolu, who is the Governor of Ondo State, to face the governance of his state. This followed his coming to Ado Ekiti last week to campaign for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Kayode Fayemi. A statement by its Director of Media and Publicity, Lere Olayinka, described Akeredolu as “a failure advertising another failure.” He said: “Ekiti is not a state to be taken by force by anyone and annex to Ondo State. We have never served a foreign god and we are not going to start now.” “However, let it be said expressly that if he likes, he could deploy one year income of Ondo State to finance Fayemi’s election, but it would lead to failure. Also, the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, has accused the APC of turning Ekiti State into a war zone. Secondus stated this at the inauguration of the Ekiti State Campaign Council in Abuja. He alleged that the ruling party was training a special killer squad to kill opponents and disperse rallies organised by the PDP. He said; “the motive of this deliberate police state being established by the ruling party is obvious. It is to distract and disorganise the opponent to enable them hold on to power and establish a one party state.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
