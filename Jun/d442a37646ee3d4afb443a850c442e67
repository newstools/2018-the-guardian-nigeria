The Nasarawa State chapter chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Husseini Muhammed, has threatened to sue any reporter that ‘incriminates’ the Fulani ethnic group. He gave the threat yesterday in Lafia following the widespread report on the killing of three policemen and eight Agatu citizens at Maraba-Udege settlement in Nasarawa Council area of Nasarawa State. Reacting to the involvement of herdsmen in the killings on phone, Muhammed said his association was ready to sue “journalists who dare to involve Fulani herdsmen in the event of any killings in their reports. “Why should the word Fulani herdsmen be used anytime there is killing? That amounts to criminalising the entire Fulani tribe and we will not take that again. “The media are the one fuelling this hatred against the Fulani people and we will sue any journalist whose report reflects this henceforth.” He continued: “We are not in support of any Fulani man who kills or gets himself involved in any criminal activities. The police should arrest and prosecute any Fulani man if caught. “Other tribes like the Niger Delta people started kidnapping but nobody mentions Niger Delta whenever a kidnapper is arrested, but when ever killings is committed, it is Fulani herdsmen, we can’t take this any more.” The association therefore, cautioned journalists to desist henceforth from using the word ‘Fulani herdsmen’ in the event of any killings.
