Rio Ferdinand Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand revealed on twitter that he is divided in his choice of support for the game between Nigeria and Argentina. The former England defender, who is currently a Pundit with the BBC said a part of him wanted to support one of the best players ever, in Lionel Messi, to produce entertainment quality while his other part wants his Nigerian friends to go in and produce a magical display. He tweeted alongside two photos of himself in a Nigerian native attire.  Although Ferdinand did not have a Nigeria teammate during his playing career, it is believed he has ties with Nigeria after he came to Lagos, Nigeria on a two-day visit. Ferdinand, 39, was given a chieftaincy title when he was in Nigeria in 2008. The Oba of Lagos, King Rilwan Akiolu gave him the title of Chief ‘Fiwagboye’. Nigeria play against Argentina in the final group game that could decide who goes through to the next round at St Petersburg. Ferdinand tweeted in October, 2015 to wish his ‘Nigerian friends and fans’, a happy independence before cheekily reminding them he is still a chief.  The Super Eagles will hope to stop Messi from producing some of the magic Ferdinand hopes to see when both sides meet by 7 p.m.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
