The Ogun State police command has arrested a woman, Amudalat Taiwo, aged 21, for dumping her 12-day-old baby inside a pit toilet. The incident occurred on June 20, at 28, Isheri Street Ilaro. Taiwo was said to have thrown the baby into the pit because she could not cater for the newborn. It was gathered that Taiwo was apprehended following reports from her landlord, Oshunshina Olawale, who went to urinate at the wee hours of the day only to hear cries of a baby inside the latrine. Olawale was said to have made an entry at the Ilaro Police Station, prompting the Divisional Officer, Sunday Opebiyi, a Chief Superintendent (CSP), to lead a team to the scene. According to the command’s spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), the toilet was broken and the baby rescued. He said: “Investigation revealed that the suspect gave birth to the baby. She was arrested and she claimed that she was an orphan married to one Taiwo Owolabi, a married man with five children. “She said the husband was not taking care of her and the baby. That she has no mean of catering for the new born and decided to discard the child. “The said husband has been arrested for failure to provide necessary welfare, while the case has been transferred to Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Labour Unit of State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID). The baby is in a stable condition at Stella Obasanjo Orphanage.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
