APC National Chairman John Odigie-Oyegun The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has ruled out the possibility of seeking a second term in office at the party’s national convention scheduled to hold on June 23. Oyegun, who made this known during an interactive session with journalists in Abuja, yesterday, explained that the decision was in the best interest of the party and has received the endorsement of his family members and close associates. He thanked members of the party for their support while discharging his duties in the past four years, adding: “I have taken this decision without prejudice to my commitment to the party in helping to solve some of the subsisting and emerging difficult issues and my ability to continue to provide necessary leadership. “However, I believe the party faces difficult days ahead and all critical stakeholders in its leadership would be required to bind together for a common purpose. “Therefore, the less contentious our national convention is, the better for the party. “I have always sought to be part of solving the problem of the APC; I do not intend to be part of the problem for the APC to solve. It is for this reason that I hereby declare that I will not be seeking re-election as the national chairman of the APC.” Nevertheless, Odigie-Oyegun said he would continue to perform his duties as national chairman of the APC till the end of his tenure on June 25, when the new set of party executives would have been inaugurated. He said the recently conducted ward, local government and states congresses were in the best interest of the party, in spite of the crises that trailed the exercise.
