If the Cassava sector is properly repositioned, it is capable of saving the African continent about $1.2b, which can be redirected into the continent’s domestic economies.
 
Director for Agriculture, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Martin Fregene, disclosed this at the just concluded fourth International conference on cassava, organised by the Global Cassava Partnerships for the 21st Century (GCP21), in Cotonou, Republic of Benin.
 
To achieve this, the AfDB promised to invest $120m in the next two to three years to boost productivity and transform cassava and eight other commodities in the continent.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
