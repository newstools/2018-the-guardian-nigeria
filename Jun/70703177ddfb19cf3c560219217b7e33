The three-time African champion will then meet Iceland and Argentina in their last group game. Speaking to The Guardian at the finals of the MRS Kids Cup Competition, as one of the special guests that included former international, Peter Rufai, Eguavoen hopes Eagles win the World Cup in Russia but doubts the team’s depth, let alone winning. “As I always say, a team’s first game will determine how far it can go at a tournament. If we can win our first game, I am sure we can get to the quarterfinals. But if we don’t win the first match, the question is do we have the character to come back? That I can’t say. “Some big countries bounce back when they lose their first game, but for small countries, it can be a bit difficult. Let’s see how it goes because none of the teams would have settled down at the start of their first game. And if we can unsettle the Croatians, it might go a long way in giving us confidence to prosecute other games,” he said. “A quarterfinal berth will be a good feat for us, but I am not pleased with the players we would have on the bench because we only have 13 to 14 key players, who I think can fully represent us well… My prayer is that we don’t have injuries and also that Moses Simon makes the team to the World Cup. He is such an exciting player to watch and the nation needs his service at the World Cup,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
