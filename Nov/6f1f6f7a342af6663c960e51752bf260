 Soccer Football – World Cup – Final – France v Croatia – Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow, Russia – July 15, 2018  Croatia’s Ivan Strinic in action   REUTERS/Christian Hartmann  The 31-year-old — a key member of the Croatian team that reached the World Cup final this summer — signed a three-year deal with Milan in July but has not yet played for the club. A routine check-up last August discovered the former Napoli and Sampdoria player was suffering from a heart condition and would need to take a break. But the club said that the player had been given the green light after undergoing a series of medical tests at the Cardiology Clinic in Padua this week. The player was diagnosed as having an “athlete’s heart,” which is not a dangerous condition, the club said. Strinic, who has won 49 caps for Croatia in a nine-year international career, will return to training on Monday.
