Emirates Airlines yesterday launched the “fly better” campaign to showcase the airline’s in-flight entertainment system and its diverse offering. President, Emirates Airline, Tim Clark, said the airlines has grown over time with brand promises to Nigerians unchanged, hence the new brand promise will not fail. “On this day in 1985, Emirates flew its first customers from Dubai to Karachi. While the airline has grown exponentially since, our promise to customers remains unchanged – flying Emirates means enjoying a better flying,” Clark said. Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications, Marketing and Brand, Boutros Boutros, added that the drive to innovate and ‘be better’ was hardwired into Emirates’ system, and “this enables us deliver air travel experiences that are comfortable in every cabin class.” “Emirates was the first to introduce personal screens in every seat in every class, we led the way for better international telephone and Wi-Fi services onboard, we pioneered private suites in first class, brought bars and shower spas onboard, and we continue to introduce game-changing products like virtual windows. Now, we are affirming that superiority and inviting travellers to ‘Fly Better’ with Emirates”. The campaign, directed by Michael Gracey, was created by Emirates’ head of brand, Richard Billington. The ice ad spot will debut on television from 1 November on the popular entertainment show ‘The X Factor UK’, and both ad spots will subsequently air across Emirates’ key markets across the GCC, in the UK, France, Germany, and the USA. In addition to traditional advertising and digital platforms, the new ‘Fly Better’ brand promise will also be rolled out across Emirates’ sponsorships and events portfolio. The first ‘Emirates Fly Better’ in-stadium branding will be unveiled at the Meydan racecourse in Dubai from 1 November, in time for the start of the racing season. This will be followed by global exposure via the on-field perimeter billboards at the much-anticipated Arsenal vs. Liverpool football match on 3 November. On 11 November, Emirates-sponsored team AC Milan will also debut Fly Better for the first time on their team jerseys, in their highly-anticipated Serie A match against rivals Juventus.
