 [FILE PHOTO] Ogun State Governor, Ibikunle Amosun  Majekodunmi, who spoke with journalists in Abeokuta, the state capital at the weekend, said the governor who through his achievements had been regarded as the “architect of the modern day Ogun State,” should not make the mistake of taking a political decision that “will consign his name into political oblivion.” According to him, the governor has served the people of the state diligently for over seven years with “landmark achievements scattering all over the state,” hence history would be kind to him if he “allows reason to prevail and work assiduously for the victory of the party both at the state and federal levels.” Majekodunmi advised that the governor should “reconcile” with Dapo Abiodun “who has publicly announced his resolve to work with him, concede some grey areas to him and most importantly pledge to continue his good works in the state.” He also enjoined Amosun not to play any “spoiler game” by working against the interest of the APC. “Nobody would dispute the fact that Governor Ibikunle Amosun has become the architect of modern day Ogun State with many landmark achievements scattered all over the state. Indeed, whenever the history of the state would be written, his name cannot but be in gold. And as the sitting governor, he is a major stakeholder whose views and interest must be important and paramount.” “But as a politician who has always been committed to the APC, I want to sincerely appeal to the governor to see the present issue concerning the gubernatorial candidate of the party as a test of his statesmanship in which the interest of the party must be supreme, not only because of the entire members of the party in the state but of President Muhammadu Buhari, whom the governor always hold in high esteem,” he said.
