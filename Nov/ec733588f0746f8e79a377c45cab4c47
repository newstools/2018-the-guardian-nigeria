ACPN presidential candidate Oby Ezekwesili in a meeting with former head of state Ibrahim Babangida in Minna…PHOTO: Twitter/Obyezeks Presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) Omoyele Sowore on Monday slammed presidential candidate of Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) Obiageli Ezekwesili for meeting with former Nigeria Head of State Ibrahim Babangida. Ezekwesili, a former Nigeria education minister, had been a critic of the current president Muhammadu Buhari’s administration and previous governments in the country for being corrupt. “I had a very candid conversation with former head of state, Ibrahim Babangida in Minna after my speech on Human Capital Development at El Amin School yesterday,” Ezekwesili tweeted on Monday. “I made it clear that Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the Old Order. This is our mission.” Since her declaration to contest the office of president in 2019, Ezekwesili has engaged Nigerians in different areas of the country to solicit their votes at the polls. But Sowore deemed her meeting with the former Nigerian military ruler as a mistake that should not have happened. “PHOTOSPEAK: Our dear Oby Ezekwesili wants to stop corruption and mis-governance in Nigeria but then holds a secret session with The Godfather Of corruption and bad governance, IBB. Nigerians, Oby creatively coined BUTIKU. I love it! But this single visit is “OBYTIKU” . Go figure!”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
