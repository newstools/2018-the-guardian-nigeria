Organisers of the Higher Institution Football League (HiFL) have dismissed claims that a court injunction has been granted to stop the finals of the HiFL scheduled for November 3. A press statement by Alhaji Shuaibu Gara-Gombe, CEO of Green White Green Centre Limited, published in one of the dailies, alleged that an injunction has been granted by the Federal High Court, Ikoyi to stop the final and the third place match on Saturday. Sola Fijabi, Director PACE sport and entertainment, has however insisted that the final will hold as scheduled with arrangements still in place. “After due consultation with our legal team, we have been reliably informed that no such injunction has been granted by the Federal High Court. We believe that this is a plot by Alhaji Gara-Gombe to disrupt the arrangements in place for the scheduled matches. Therefore, please note that the matches scheduled for Saturday, November 3rd will hold as planned as arrangements are still in place to ensure same,” he said in a statement. The competition in its maiden edition organised by PACE sports and entertainment, has been a rousing success attracting notable sponsors and fans from around the country. With UNICAL Malabites and UAM Tillers set to face-off in the final 3:00pm on Saturday at the Agege Stadium, the organisers have labelled their work in the development and exposure of sporting talents across the higher institutions ‘a sterling feat’ while promising future editions. FIjabi also noted that the league “holds the potential to place Nigeria on the global sports map, particularly in the collegiate sports community and beyond.” After the losers’ finals at 10:00am between Unilorin Warriors and OAU Giants at the Agege Stadium, HiFL, which commenced on August 1, will hit its crescendo in the final after 14 weeks and 16 participants.
