According to Onu, with the new policy, leather from Nigeria can now be processed into finished goods before export. He said the implementation of the leather policy would also help in the production of finished goods like shoes, bags. The minister noted that government intends to create additional jobs through increased activities in the leather industry as small-scale business will spring up. “National leather and leather products policy will enable government attract more investment into the sector. We would now harness our leather resources in a manner that will allow us make more gains instead of exporting raw leather or semi-finished products. “This is the only way we can create more jobs, wealth and be in a position to fight poverty,” he said.
