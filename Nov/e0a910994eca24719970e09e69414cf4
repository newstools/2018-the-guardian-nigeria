Nevada State law and GOP officials encouraged voters to cast their ballots for the 72-year old brothel owner in order to stop Democrats from winning the seat. During the poll declaration, Hof had 68.3% of the vote to defeat his Democrat rival Lesia Romanov who polled 31.7%. “He’s not going to make it to the promised land with us but we hope he’s watching from the great beyond. He died quietly in his sleep,” Hof’s campaign manager Chuck Muth said at one of the brothels he operated in Crystal, Nevada. Muth  also stated the election day was “bittersweet”. The strip club owner, who ran five legal brothels in Nevada, during his campaign, dubbed himself the “Trump from Pahrump” in reference to the town where he lived in Nevada. He was found dead by porn star Ron Jeremy and a friend who went to wake him for a meeting, hours after his weekend-long 72nd birthday party. Nevada Police, however, said they did not suspect foul play at the time of his death and no one that was with him the night before noticed any signs of ill health. Hof’s campaign was based on deeply conservative ideals including a hard-line policy on immigration and expansion of gun rights. He also fought against outlawing brothels. Another Republican will be appointed to serve in his place after results showed the late brothel owner received over 60% of the vote.
