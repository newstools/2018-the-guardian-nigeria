Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State has called off a meeting with labour leaders on the minimum wage crisis, citing the inability of the Federal Government to agree yet on a figure. Yesterdayâ€™s botched parley at the State House, Ikeja, was a follow-up to the one earlier presided over by the Commissioner for Establishment, Trainings and Pensions, Dr. Akintola Benson Oke. It was gathered that the governor was advised to put off the meeting to a later date considering the fact that the Federal Government had not taken a definite position on the matter.The gathering, it was learnt, would have settled the issue once and for all in the state.
