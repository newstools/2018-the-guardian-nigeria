He knows what injury is. “From my experience, the painful scream and way it happened, it will be a long time. “It is not a little muscular injury that he will be ready in a week or 10 days. “For me and Alexis Sanchez, the grade is different to the one that Lindelof (expected to miss three weeks due to a thigh strain suffered against Crystal Palace last weekend) has and that was not easy.” Sanchez’s first team starts have been rare in November, and he came on as a substitute in the league games against Manchester City and Crystal Palace. He last started in the victory at Juventus in the Champions League on November 7. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
