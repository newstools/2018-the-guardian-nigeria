Agom Adara Maiwada Galadima Officials of the Department of State Security Services (DSS) on Wednesday arrested six suspects alleged to have been involved in the killing of the traditional ruler of Adara Chiefdom in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Chief Maiwada Galadima. The suspects were paraded on Wednesday at the state headquarters of the DSS in Kaduna. DSS official, who briefed journalists said the suspects, were tracked and arrested at different locations in Igabi, Soba, Kachia and Jos in Plateau State. Galadima, his wife and driver were abducted on Friday, October 19. Gunmen had intercepted the convoy of the traditional ruler along Kaduna-Kachia road and opened fire on the vehicles which forced them to submit to the kidnappers. The wife and driver were later released, but the monarch was killed a week after on Friday, October 26. The abductors dumped his body by the roadside at Kateri village, on Kaduna-Abuja highway. Kaduna State Government, while announcing his death, described Galadima as a quintessential traditional ruler. “The Kaduna state government extends its condolences to the family of this revered leader and to people of the chiefdom he led with dedication and commitment,” the state government said in a statement signed by governor Nasir El-Rufai’s media aide Samuel Aruwan. Meanwhile, the Senate on Wednesday called on the Federal Government to immediately form a judicial commission enquiry into the crisis in Kaduna and the eventual kidnapping and murder of the Chief Galadima.
