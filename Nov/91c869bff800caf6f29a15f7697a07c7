Femi Otedola has endorsed the All Progressives Congress Lagos State governorship candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu for governor. Otedola, who is the Chairman of Forte Oil PLC, was only last month rumoured to be running for governor on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, a report which he neither denied nor confirmed. A caption Otedola wrote for a photo he took with Sanwo-Olu read in part, “Dinner at my residence yesterday evening with my childhood friend, APC governorship candidate, Jide Sanwo-Olu; the governor in waiting.” Media entrepreneur, Dele Momodu had said in September that Otedola had personally confirmed to him that he would be contesting the governorship seat. However, the talks of Otedola’s governorship ambition cooled after Jimi Agbaje emerged the PDP governorship candidate. Agbaje, contesting for the governorship seat for a third time will stand as a major opposition to Sanwo-Olu and the ruling APC. The post on Otedola’s official Instagram handle on Saturday, which described Sanwo-Olu as his childhood friend and the incoming governor of Lagos State, also suggests that the oil mogul is ready to throw his weight behind the APC candidate. Sanwo-Olu defeated incumbent governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, in the APC governorship primary that was held to emerge the party’s candidate heading into the 2019 polls. He is believed to be favoured by former Lagos State governor and APC national leader, Bola Tinubu. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
