In previous years, the Swiss superstar had won the event twice in Houston, twice in Shanghai and twice in London. The London carnival parades the world’s top eight singles players and top eight doubles pairs by rankings. In the countdown to this year’s event, the world number two, Rafael Nadal and number four, Juan Martin Del Potro withdrew on account of injury; enabling both Kei Nishikori and John Isner to make the list. The eight players are placed together in two groups, named after past champions, Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil and Lleyton Hewitt of Australia. The event kicked off with a doubles match between Britain’s Jamie Murray pairing Brazil’s Bruno Soares against Serbia’s Nicola Mektic and Alexander Peye of Austria. The first match in the singles round robin pitched South Africa’s Kevin Anderson against Dominic Thiem of Austria. Kevin holds a 6-2 record on career meetings with his opponent. Roger Federer is billed to tackle Japan’s Kei Nishikori to round up the opening day in London’s O2 Arena. Stefanos Tsitsipas emerged the Next Gen champion as he defeated Alex de Minaur 2/4, 4/1, 4/3 (3), 4/3(3) in one hour 41 minutes. The victory capped an 11-month season in which he was winner in Stockholm and runner up to Nadal in both Barcelona and Toronto. The rising Greek tennis star started the year ranked 91 and has risen to 15. He will be eligible to defend his title next year, although his solid game is expected to result in further progress in the rankings. Alex De Minaur acquitted himself well, as he topped his group in the round robin. In the semifinals, he defeated Spain’s Jaime Munar, who was the first player from his country to participate in the two-year history of the age-grade tournament. The Spaniard won a close first tie break 4/3 (5) but Alex proceeded to win the next three convincingly, 4/1, 4/1, 4/2, an indication of a good performer under pressure. At age 19 and youngest of the contestants this year, he will be back next year.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
