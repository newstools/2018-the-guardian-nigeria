Parkinson’s disease is an incurable brain disease that affects the senses, memory and mood. According to studies conducted in the US, the disease possibly starts from the appendix and those who have removed theirs are less prone to develop the disease. The function of the appendix for a long time has not been explained but recently have been discovered to contain a substance that destroys the brain cells.
The appendix is a small sac at the opening of the large intestine that is known to have no use in the body. It has been discovered that in Parkinson’s, toxic proteins build up in the brain to destroy nerves, especially those linked with movement. The contents of people’s appendix have been examined and it has been discovered that it has the toxic protein called alpha synuclein – that is found in the brains of Parkinson’s patients. The appendix however is not the cause of Parkinson’s because removing it would have been the ultimate solution. The scientists state that it is the organ where the protein thrives which moves up to the brain. Although they do not advise that people go and have their appendix removed, as this is not a sure protection against Parkinson’s disease. However, the search for the origins of Parkinson’s still has not made it clear why the disease develops in some people but not others.
