 9mobile center  This development came 15 months after the pull-out of Etisalat, the United Arab Emirate (UAE) telecommunications firm, from Nigeria. Teleology Holdings emerged the preferred bidder ahead of Smile Telecoms Holdings after bidding $301 million for the telecommunications firm. The Guardian gathered that the transfer of ownership to Teleology came after the issuance of final approval of no objection by the Board of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to the effect that the technical and financial bids Teleology submitted for 9mobile met and satisfied all the regulatory requirements. A statement signed by one of the new non-Executive Directors, Mohammed Edewor, and made available to journalists, confirmed this development yesterday. “Following the successful completion of the tenure of the former board appointed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and in fulfilment of the consequential transfer of final ownership, Teleology Nigeria Limited is now the new investor. “We thank all out-going members of the board for helping to shepherd 9mobile through the critical transition phase it has passed through since July 2017 and wish them the very best in their future assignments.” The new directors are Nasiru Ado Bayero (Chairman), Asega Aliga, Adrian Wood, Mohammed Edewor and Winston Ndubueze Udeh (Non-Executive Directors). Others are Abdulrahman Ado, an Executive Director and Stephane Beuvelet, Acting Managing Director. Bayero, who welcomed the appointment, said: “As we begin this new epochal phase, we wish to thank all the employees who built this viable business. Our debt of gratitude also goes to our subscribers even as we assure them to get ready for real best-in-class additional value for their relationship with the 9mobile brand” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
