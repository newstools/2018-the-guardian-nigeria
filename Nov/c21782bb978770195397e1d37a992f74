Former first lady of the United States of America, Michelle Obama, writes a passage in her new book “Becoming” explaining how the predecessor first lady, Laura Bush, extended her help to her as an incoming first lady by telling her that if she needed help, she was just a phone call away. In her book, Michelle writes she also extended the same courtesy to Melania Trump when it was her turn to occupy the role of America’s first lady.
