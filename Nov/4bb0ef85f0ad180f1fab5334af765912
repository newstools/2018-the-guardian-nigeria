 Cross River State governor Professor Ben Ayade  Ayade, who was bitter over the disqualification of his friend, Mr. Chris Agara from the Cross River Central senatorial primaries by the PDP opened up on the primaries for the first time at a recent launch of the State Microfinance Bank in Calabar. Ayade said: “I have spent more money than any other candidate in the state. PDP is a party that is so unfair and has got no conscience. A man came ready for election and you take out his name from the ballot paper. “You take out his name because you know he is too powerful. When people use God’s given opportunities to do injustice, injustice would wait for them. So for my brother, I asked you to be strong and abide in the faith of God, because it is God’s will. But for those who the devil has used to stop the instrumentality, challenge and direction of God at the fullness of time, Holy Ghost would visit them with their own mighty fire”. Ayade who was excited that Agara did not defect to another despite pressure said,  “let us shame the devil. Let us shame the enemies. Let us shame all those who thought that they can put a fight between two brothers. We have conquered. We are the richest Cross Riverians in the oil and gas industry. Our politics has no business with our brotherhood. My brother you are welcome. “This is a brother indeed. He is the only brother that can also give his right eye to protect me. It is my brother that even in pains, with all enemies gathered in his house. Instead of me to hurt my brother, I would rather not be in politics. This is politics with ethics. “This is true brotherhood. My brother who has said, he would rather forget politics and stand by his brother. But you will be shocked that people we have literally helped in the days of their poverty, they connived to conspire and carry rumours and stories to destroy brotherhood of over 30 years.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
