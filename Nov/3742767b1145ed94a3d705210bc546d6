The leader of Islamic Movement of nigeria otherwise known as Shi”te, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) said it considers the statement made by information minister Lai Mohammed, that the government spends about N3.5 million on a monthly basis to feed its leader Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky as an insult. Mohammed had in a video said the cost of feeding Shiite leader runs over three million Naira since he has being in detention in December 2015. “We consider the statement of the Minister of information as an insult to the personality of our leader. We advise the Minister to desist from involving the Sheikh in his unfortunate lies and for once tell Nigerians the actual truth that the government does not spend such amount on Sheikh Zakzaky,” IMN spokesman Ibrahim Musa said in a statement. Musa alleged that the minister’s claim was a ‘grand deception’ of President Buhari led-administration to present ‘a human face’ after it brutally slaughtered more than one thousand innocent and defenseless civilians in Zaria in December 2015. “This clearly shows that some security officers are looting public funds under the guise of keeping the Sheikh under ‘protective custody’ which a federal high court in Abuja has since declared illegal under the constitution.” “This same government had also told the world through the Federal High Court in Abuja that the Sheikh didn’t do anything wrong, but they shot him and the wife and all the atrocities were only to protect him. The Court was not convinced and so ordered that he should be set free. The government reneged,” he said The group’s spokesman also pleaded with the government to free El-Zakzaky to enable him to seek medical treatment abroad considering his age and poor health condition. “We reiterate our call for the government to free Sheikh Zakzaky to enable him to seek medical treatment abroad,” Musa said.
