We hope that this maiden TEDx event serves as a catalyst for the spreading and generation of ideas in our local community. Our aim is to shift the mindsets of participants to think in line with the fast paced nature of global systems and challenge themselves to play active roles in shaping their community. Here are some of the speakers: Prof. Peter Ebigbo, Mark Okoye, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, Amarachi Attamah, Gloria Ukata, Festus Adibe, H.E Sullivan Chime, Samson Itodo, Myles Igwebuike and Chinedu Chukwuelue.
