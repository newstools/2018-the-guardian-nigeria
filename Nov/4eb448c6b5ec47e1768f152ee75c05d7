 [FILE PHOTO] Nigeria Police.  Mr Mukan Joseph, the Commissioner of Police in the state, said this in Yenagoa on Wednesday, while addressing a group of students. The students had staged a protest at the command headquarters over the killing of their colleague in the Niger-Delta University by a policeman on patrol. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Tariela Nikade, a 300 level Petro-Chemical Engineering student, was reportedly shot dead near her residence on Tenacious Road, Edepie, Yenagoa, on Nov. 23. “We, the police, urge you to accept our sympathy over the death of Tariela Nikade who was shot by an officer, Sergeant Timadi Emmanuel. “The officer has been tried and dismissed from the Nigeria Police Force. Meanwhile investigation is ongoing and he will soon be charged to court. “On the issue of raid, it will continue because we are not raiding the wrong people. We raid on hideout of criminals and if we pick the innocent person, he or she cannot be charged. “We are aware of security challenges in Yenagoa; armed robbery and cultism here and there. So, we are not going to fold our alms and not secure lives in Bayelsa,” he said. The protesting student, who matched to the police headquarters with placards bearing different inscriptions, decried extrajudicial killing by police in Bayelsa and the country at large. Mr Benjamine Ebimobowie, President, National Association of Bayelsa Student, said the protest was to register their grievances over the killing of its member. Ebimobowie urged the police to be professional in the discharge of their duties and stop killing and molestation of innocent citizens across the state.
