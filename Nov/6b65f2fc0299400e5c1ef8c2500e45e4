 [FILE PHOTO] INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmoud Yakubu  Yakubu also warned the political parties to play by the rules as campaigns for presidential and National Assembly elections begin on November 18, this year. The INEC boss, who spoke at the sixth convocation lecture of Oduduwa University, Ile Ife, Osun State, titled: “The challenges and prospect of leadership recruitment for good governance in Nigeria,” said the electoral body’s role is to provide a level playing field for all political parties and ensure electoral process is credible while the onus is on Nigerians to elect their leaders. However, he said the INEC would make vote-buying practically impossible during the 2019 general elections. Meanwhile, the Commission has said that it is partnering with the police to recover no fewer than 2,045 Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) stolen from its office in Okobo Local Council of Akwa Ibom State.
