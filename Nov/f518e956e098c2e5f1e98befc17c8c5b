The course of Nigeria's war against Islamist militants has turned against the government with reports that as many as 100 soldiers have been killed by an Islamic State offshoot since Sunday, Lucy Fielder reports. As many as a hundred Nigerian soldiers have been killed in the northeast of the country since Sunday, November 18 with the finger of blame pointed at an Islamic State offshoot. That information comes from five security sources, all speaking on a condition of anonymity. Nigeria's northeast is a restive region where the government is battling Islamist militants including Islamic State West Africa and Boko Haram. The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, who faces an election battle in February, has repeatedly claimed to have won the war against the extremist insurgents. That was refuted by an attack on Sunday in Metele, in Borno State. On Thursday, the Nigerian Senate suspended its session in honour of the 44 soldiers they said had died. Four of the anonymous security sources said around 100 had died in the Metele incident alone while the fifth said that 96 had died in Metele but also in other attacks.
