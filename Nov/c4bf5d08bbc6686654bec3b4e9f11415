Film streaming platform, Netflix, has cancelled Marvel’s Daredevil after three seasons. This is coming right after the platform cancelled Iron Fist and Luke Cage last month. In a statement released to Deadline, the streamer wrote: “Marvel’s Daredevil will not return for a fourth season on Netflix. We are tremendously proud of the show’s last and final season and although it’s painful for the fans, we feel it best to close this chapter on a high note. We’re thankful to our partners at Marvel, showrunner Erik Oleson, the show’s writers, stellar crew and incredible cast including Charlie Cox as Daredevil himself, and we’re grateful to the fans who have supported the show over the years,” Netflix added just a month after the third season of the series launched on the service. While the series on Netflix has ended, the three existing seasons will remain on the service for years to come, while the Daredevil character will live on in future projects for Marvel.” With this latest development, Jessica Jones and The Punisher are the two Marvel series left on the platform. However, Deadline notes that “Marvel shows are costly to make” and the Marvel/Disney colloboration with Netflix is not making any headway, it is likely that Disney’s forthcoming service, Disney+ might be onto something with it.
