 Cross River State governor Professor Ben Ayade  Odey conveyed the commendation on Monday in Calabar at a one-day political stakeholders’ summit, organised by FAD 360TV/FAD 93.1 FM, a Calabar-based broadcasting outfit. “In a world where the fight for women emancipation and gender equality has taken the front burner, the government of Cross River has blazed the trail to become a leading light in the crusade for gender equality,’’ she said. She said that in furtherance of this objective, the Ministry of Women Affairs had trained several women in skill acquisition schemes, while empowering the trainees with starter packs. “This goes a long way in making the beneficiaries entrepreneurs and employers of labour in the near future, and it will also help them to support their families economically. “The employment of women, mostly widows, in the Calabar Garment Factory by the state government, is also a good example of economic empowerment for women in Cross River,’’ she said. The commissioner, who described the Ayade-administration as gender friendly, called for the inclusion of more women in governance processes at all levels of government across the country. Speaking, Mr Fidelis Duker, the Managing Director of FAD Broadcasting Media, said that the objective of the summit was to bring together political stakeholders to discuss salient issues in the lead-up to the 2019 elections. “This will create a platform for an interactive session where the participants could network, engage meaningfully and discuss on how the elections could be more credible, transparent and violence-free,’’ he added.
