 Ben Nwoye  But the state PDP chairman, Chief Augustine Nnamani, stated yesterday: “Ordinarily, the state chapter of the PDP would have wished not to join issues with the opposition APC over series of mischievous allegations against our great party, but since this recent accusation is capable of undermining the enviable style of governance in the state, anchored on peace, good governance, decency, credibility and respect for all institutions, tßhe need to react becomes imperative. “PDP did not, and certainly will not, prevent any other political party in the state from mounting its billboard in any approved location. The PDP-led state government has already mounted billboards in strategic locations welcoming the Vice President, His Excellency, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, to Enugu State on Friday, November 23, in line with our standing tradition of according respect each time the president or his vice visits the state, which they always appreciate.
 
“Such act of hospitality and the demand of protocol from the PDP government in Enugu should not be seen by the APC as an opportunity to misrepresent issues and lie against the PDP.” The APC had alleged that the PDP was destroying the billboards it mounted in the state to welcome Osinbajo tomorrow and those of its governorship candidate, Senator Ayogu Eze, through its agents in the state. It alleged that billboards bearing President Muhammadu Buhari and Eze were also being destroyed.APC stated that PDP had 2,294 billboards across the state, but resorted to “intimidating owners of billboards to ensure that we do not get space to advertise Buhari and our governorship candidate.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
