 Super Eagles’ Manager, Gernot Rohr believes Nigeria has grown tremendously since its early exit at the Russia 2018 World Cup, adding, however, that there are still room for improvement.  Nigeria has won three matches and drawn two since that infamous night in St. Petersburg, where Argentina sent the Eagles out of the World Cup. Since then, Nigeria has beaten Seychelles, Libya home and away and drawn with South Africa in their African Nations Cup qualifying series. The team on Tuesday in Asaba drew goalless with Uganda in a friendly international. In that game on Tuesday, the Franco-German gave some new players the opportunity to stake their claims in the team and at the end he said he was satisfied with the vision of tomorrow he saw in Asaba. He also said he used Tuesday’s game to start preparations for next year’s African Nations Cup, adding that he would employ more of such matches on the way to Cameroun. The manager also revealed that he was starting on a clean slate, saying that every member of the team, including Skipper Mikel Obi, must justify his inclusion in the squad. Rohr said the China-based Mikel must prove that he still deserved a place in the squad, adding that there was no automatic shirt for any player. He, however, acknowledged that Mikel has been battling with fitness issues lately, assuring that all the players that have not featured in the recent games would be given the opportunity to contest for inclusion in subsequent games. The Guardian learnt that Rohr would start his vacation this weekend after meeting with a section of the media today.
