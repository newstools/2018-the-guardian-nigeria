Nigerian singer 2Face Idibia could not hold back his tears at an event yesterday when his wife, Nollywood actress, Annie Idibia and his baby mama Pero Adeniyi made peace after years of animosity. The animosity stemmed from the singer dating Annie Macauley Idibia, Pero Adeniyi, and Sunmbo Ajaba Adeoye and having kids with all three of them within the same period. 2Face ended up marrying Annie. Although Annie and Sunmbo enjoy a cordial relationship and their kids are really close, she and Pero are not on good terms. Annie and Pero, however, put their differences aside at an event held yesterday at Crescendo Lounge in Ikeja. Both women hugged as 2Face’s One Love sang in the background. The gesture moved 2Face to tears and he could not control his emotions and broke down sobbing as both women included him in a group hug. “Stop,” Pero can be seen mouthing to Tuface as he cried.
