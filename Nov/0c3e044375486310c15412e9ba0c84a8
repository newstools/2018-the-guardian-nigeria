Presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) and former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)Professor Kingsley Moghalu has announced Deputy National Chairman of the party, Mrs. Umma Getso as his vice-presidential running mate for the 2019 elections. Mrs. Getso, 37, is from Kano State. She is a political activist and business entrepreneur who previously
co-founded the National Progressive Movement (NPM). Mrs. Getso is a passionate advocate for the education of the girl-child in the northern states of Nigeria.
She is also the daughter of the late Abdullahi Giwa Getso, a political leader in Kano in his lifetime,who was elected a senator in 1983 on the platform of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). According to a statement made available to The Guardian yesterday, Moghalu said he chose Getso because of his belief that the solution to Nigeria’s problems lies with the
youth demographic. “My choice of Umma Getso is a recognition of her talent, leadership ability, and a passionate commitment to a better future for the youth of Nigeria” “It also is consistent  with my strong commitment to women as full partners in nation-building. I restate my target of 50:50  gender parity in the composition of my cabinet as President of Nigeria in 2019”. Founded in 2017, the YPP is anchored on an ideology of a progressive society in which the citizen,  rather than politicians and their vested interests, is enthroned as the focus of governance. Professor Moghalu has been traversing the length and breadth of Nigeria to deliver a message of hope
and change of the old order. “The old guard and the establishment are well aware that the game is over for them. They know that their  time is up. Getso and I have come to disrupt the old way of doing things while ushering a new, more productive and creative method of governance,” he said.
