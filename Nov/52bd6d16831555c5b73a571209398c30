According to a new report, supermodel Kendall Jenner may now breathe a sigh of relief as the guy who has repeatedly shown up on her property has now been ordered to stay away from her for the next 5 years. It is learnt that a judge granted Kendall a permanent restraining order against John Ford yesterday, November 9 morning and in the judgement, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star’s stalker is required to stay at least 100 yards away from her and her home at all times. Nor can he contact her in any way. It would be recalled we reported that Ford has trespassed multiple times at Kendall’s property in her gated community. He was charged with misdemeanour criminal trespass which would bring a max sentence of 6 months in jail but due to overcrowding, he would most likely get out within days. Ford scaled the mountainside of Kendall’s crib and once ended up by her pool and another time on her porch. He was finally nabbed by cops and released after 36 hours only to be re-arrested at her home. Kendall Jenner was one of the models who recently walked the runway at the just concluded Victoria Secret’s fashion show.
