Stan Lee was a great writer and Marvel comic creator who in so many words created a universe that many lived in and enjoyed through his epic works. Fans of the Marvel comics are sad and mourn his death as much as they will mourn a god of some sort. A lot have likened him to the creator o a world. As the tributes roll in on social media, here are what some Marvel actors have to say:   I owe it all to you,,, Rest In Peace Stan… #MCU #Excelsior #legend #rip #stanlee #TeamStark A post shared by  Robert Downey Jr. (@robertdowneyjr) on Nov 12, 2018 at 11:26am PST    How many millions of us are indebted to this guy, none more so than me. The father of Marvel has made so many people so incredibly happy. What a life and what a thing to have achieved. Rest in peace Stan A post shared by   (@tomholland2013) on Nov 12, 2018 at 11:54am PST  There will never be another Stan Lee. For decades he provided both young and old with adventure, escape, comfort, confidence, inspiration, strength, friendship and joy. He exuded love and kindness and will leave an indelible mark on so, so, so many lives.

Stan Lee was a pioneering force in the superhero universe. I’m proud to have been a small part of his legacy and …. to have helped bring one of his characters to life. #StanLee #Wolverine pic.twitter.com/SQMlGvrCv5 — Hugh.M.
