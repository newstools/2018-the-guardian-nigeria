Former Spain and Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez has indicated he will retire from playing at the end of the season. Xavi has played for Qatari club Al Sadd since 2015 but is best known for his glittering career at Barca, where he won eight La Liga and four Champions League titles. “It’s going to be my last year, in January I’ll turn 39 and I think it’s time to say goodbye,” Xavi said in an interview with Spanish radio station Cadena Ser on Thursday night. Xavi was also instrumental in Spain’s unprecedented period of success between 2008 and 2012, when La Roja won the World Cup and the European Championships twice. Regularly linked with a return to Barcelona as coach, Xavi has made no secret of his ambition to lead his former club in the future. He insists, however, he first wants to gain experience in Qatar. “The idea is to start here in Qatar to get experience, to prove myself, it’s a new stage where I start from scratch,” Xavi added. “Coaching Barca is a big deal, you have to be very prepared and honestly, I still do not feel I am ready.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
