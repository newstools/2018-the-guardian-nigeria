An orangutan has been rescued after being used in an Indonesian sex trade. The orangutan known as Pony is an endangered Bornean monkey who services the palm oil farmers for £2 (N720). Daily Mail reveals that Pony who was taken from her mother when she was a baby was discovered in a brothel village in Kareng Pangi, Central Kalimantan is chained to a wall. Since then, she has been forced to wear perfume, taught tricks from Kamasutra and wear makeup. Pony the orangutan sitting on a chair chained.

“You could choose a human if you preferred, but it was a novelty for many of the men to have sex with an orangutan.’” Getting her released from her owner took 35 policemen armed with AK-47s. According to Lone Droscher-Nielson, a member of the team who discovered Pony told the Sun, “Perhaps in my naivety I had never thought it humanly possible to do such a thing to an animal.” Pony’s rescuers took her to a sanctuary run by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation where she seems to have found peace. It is unlikely that she will be kept in the wild due to her unfamiliarity with the area. Her captors will not face charges.
