The Guardian newspaper’s Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Debo Adesina, was yesterday attacked by suspected daredevil traffic robbers in broad day light on Oshodi Bridge. The robbers, who took to their heels immediately after the act, dispossessed him of his phones and other valuables. As at the time of the robbery, no police officer was in sight as the hoodlums had a swell moment going from car to car, smashing windscreens and collecting valuables from innocent motorists. Items stolen from Mr. Adesina include mobile phones, cash and company identity card. Lagosians have continued to call on Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to address the increasing trend in traffic robbery. The issue has escalated as the robbers now operate boldly, even near places where there are security agents. The undesirable elements are being emboldened daily with the sheer absence of governance in the state, thus unleashing mayhem on innocent commuters. They are everywhere from the Anthony stretch onto Oshodi-Isolo Expressway to Toyota Bus Stop, where Mr. Ambode’s endless construction work has worsened traffic situation that stretches from Anthony to Toyota bus stop. The hoodlums employ new tricks everyday. The robbers are mostly young men in their 20s and 30s who comb the highway where there are traffic snarls in Lagos for any slight opportunity to strike. Apart from Oshodi, other flashpoints where the hoodlums operate are Murtala Muhammed Airport Road, Costain/National Theatre, Third Mainland Bridge, Anthony-Oshodi Road, Gbagada-Oworonshoki-Ketu Expressway, Mile Two-Badagry Expressway, Ojota-Berger- Long Bridge on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and Agege Motor Road.
