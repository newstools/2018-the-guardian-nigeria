However, it transpired that Weibo user “Juventus changing room cleaning lady” — whose real name has not been reported — was alive and unharmed after Chinese media and police tracked her down. The case has drawn about 40 million views and generated thousands of comments in recent days on Weibo, where many European football clubs and players connect with their Chinese followers. Juventus’s post to its 725,000 followers mourning the supposed suicide triggered several days of criticism and shrill calls for the club to apologise. In a statement to AFP, the club said: “The agency in charge of Juventus social media accounts on Chinese digital platforms did a mistake by believing in what has then been revealed to be fake news, and we apologise for this.” The apology is unlikely to placate everyone. “Yes, you were also fooled,” wrote one Weibo user, hitting out at the Italian club. “But if you have this title (“Juventus”), at least understand that every word you say represents the image of the club.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
