The Deputy Chief Medical Director of popular Port Harcourt, Rivers State health facility, Ebony Hospitals Limited, has done a lot in the area of women health, and this has earned her numerous honours and awards. Not done yet with the accolades at home, the Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist has also caught the attention of the prestigious Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (RCOG) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, which recently recognised her work in all stages of pregnancy, from pre-conception to post-pregnancy, and bestowed its honours on her. It was an occasion of great joy for Linda and her darling husband and partner, Dr. Innocent Chi Ekwem, when she was recently honoured with the prestigious Fellowship of the Royal College in London. On the occasion, held at the Royal College Hall in Regent Park, London, she was presented with the Certificate of Awards by Professor Lesley Regan, president of the RCOG, who is also the Head of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London.

Ekwem and their children- Dr. Melvin Chibuzo Ekwem, Dr. Yvonne Ezinne Ekwem and Mr. Ugonna Cliff Ekwem, as well as Mr. Trevor Okechukwu Okonya and Mr. Reginald Ihejiahi, former chief executive of Fidelity Bank Plc, who is a brother of the awardee.
