 [FILE PHOTO] Ibadan  Acting spokesperson of Logistics command headquarters, Squadron Leader Chidinma Ojukwu, told newsmen that a panel of inquiry into the incident has been set up. According to her, “the attention of the Logistics Command of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to an online publication alleging that soldiers (NAF airmen) were harassing and shooting motorists around the Iwo Road area of Ibadan on Friday, November 9. A preliminary investigation has therefore been conducted into the incident and it was evident that the account as reported was not accurate but rather misleading. “The Logistics Command has set up a panel of inquiry into the incident. The general public can be rest assured that the NAF, being a highly professional and disciplined force, will not tolerate any acts of indiscipline that violate the rights of any Nigerian from any of its personnel or cover up any erring ones. “Any NAF personnel found wanting or culpable of any offence after full investigation shall be punished in accordance with the law of the land and in reflection of the NAF’s commitment to professionalism and responsibility to the Nigerian people. The public will be kept informed on the outcome of the investigations”. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
