Signal Alliance (SA) in collaboration with Cisco recently organised a workshop on how organisations can maximise their existing technology investments through the Cisco Lifecyle Advisor (LCA) programme. This Cisco LCA partnership enables SA to expand its relationships with customers in order for them to make the most of their IT investments through simplified processes and proven methodologies. Yinka Ntia, SA director of Technology & Business Development, said “In a study carried out by Cisco, they found that as many as 68% of System integrators aren’t tracking because the solutions they are selling are not delivering the customer’s preferred business outcomes. That is where a Cisco Lifecycle Advisor like Signal Alliance comes in to ensure improve benefits for Customer Success.” Yinka Adeosun, SA Lead Infrastructure Management & Solution Architect, demonstrated how organisations can achieve increase business outcomes in the following areas such as; an increase in technology value and return on investment, thereby gaining competitive advantage by improving total cost of ownership, business agility and technology availability. Also, an improvement in network performance, operational performance and readiness, thereby demonstrating Signal Alliance’s commitment to your business objectives. Boma Okwosa, SA Head Partnership & Program said, “The session provided a walk through the program roadmap to highlight SA value proposition and the inherent benefits to participants business.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
