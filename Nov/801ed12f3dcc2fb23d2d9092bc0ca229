Nigeria Senate on Thursday called for the investigation of the crisis that led into the Police laying siege on Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly. The House of Assembly complex in Uyo was sealed by the police, with lawmakers and staff being denied access to the premises. Akwa Ibom House of Assembly crisis erupted on Monday when the speaker Onofiok Luke declared the seat of five lawmakers who defected from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressive Congress (APC) vacant. Senator Bassey Akpan, who is representing Akwa Ibom North-East, appealed to the Senate during the plenary on for an immediate investigation of the crisis. Akpan said,“ We owe the people of Akwa Ibom this responsibility. It is not right. An injury to Akwa Ibom is an injury to Nigeria.” In reaction, deputy senate president, Ike Ekweremadu said Nigeria’s democracy will be at risk if Akwa Ibom issue was pushed aside, adding that “it is Akwa Ibom today, it may be another state tomorrow.” Also, Senator Ahmad Kaita, who represents Kankia/Ingawa/Kusada constituency of Katsina State, said police presence at the assembly was to ensure security amidst fears of clash by political supporters. “If the police vacate the premises, the legislators will go in there with their supporters and create fracas,” Kaita said. Kaita pleaded with the house to investigate fact in this issue before taking action. However, the Senate President, Bukola Saraki ordered the police to vacate the premises and to allow the legislators access to the chamber as the police’s responsibility is to maintain law and order. “The parliamentarians should still have access to the chambers there, or in any part of the country where we have a parliament. The police should vacate but still provide the necessary security,” Saraki said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
