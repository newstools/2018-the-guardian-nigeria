Canadian pop star, Justin Bieber appears to be on an emotional roller coaster lately as he has been spotted getting decidedly emotional in public spaces on several occasions in recent months. The Sorry hitmaker was recently spotted crying with his new wife Hailey Baldwin comforting him during a trip to Universal Studios’ Harry Potter-themed bar Leaky Cauldron in Orlando, Florida. The 24-year-old Grammy award-winning singer was caught on camera burying his head in his hands as 21-year-old model Hailey sat opposite him while stroking the side of his face. According to a source, the bar was cleared out by Sorry hitmaker Justin’s security team as he and Hailey ordered two drinks shortly after 11.15pm. The source said Bieber appeared ‘dishevelled and distressed’ as he tried to hide his tears beneath his white baseball cap. “We came into the Leaky Cauldron at the exact time as them so their security was in the process of moving people out,” said the eyewitness. ‘They just walked in and sat down at a table while their security got to work. They ordered a couple of butterbeers.” Justin Bieber crying with his wife, Hailey Baldwin comforting him | DailyMail It should be noted that this isn’t the first time Justin has been seen getting emotional recently.
