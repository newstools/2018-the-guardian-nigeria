The DFLA have faced accusations they are a racist and Islamophobic group, but Phillips defended them in a series of Twitter posts. “West Ham United can confirm that following suspension and subsequent investigation, academy coach Mark Phillips has been reinstated to his role in accordance with employment law, and has been reminded of his responsibilities,” said a statement issued by the east London club. In February, West Ham sacked director of player recruitment Tony Henry over remarks he had made saying some African players “cause mayhem” and that the Hammers “don’t want any more Africans”. But it is understood Phillips’ comments were insufficient to justify his dismissal for breaching the Hammers’ social media policy and bringing the club into disrepute.
