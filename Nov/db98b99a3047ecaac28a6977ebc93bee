Jay Z just referenced Kanye West in “What’s Free” off Meek Mills’s Championship album. Fans who have since been dissecting the lines in the track claim that Hov refers to Kanye’s support for Trump. Although Kanye has explained that he is staying away from politics because he has been used, Jay addresses the drama especially the MAGA hat and his spouse. No red hat, don’t Michael and Prince me and Ye/They separate you when you got Michael and Prince’s DNA/I ain’t one of these house n***as you bought/My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours/My spo—c’mon, man—my route better of course
 Mill has also waded in and verbally expressed his disapproval with Kanye’s affinity in several interviews/ Rick Ross also seems to be shading Tekashi 6ix9ine who is facing life in prison Screaming ‘gang gang’ now you wanna rap/ Racketeering charges caught him on a tap/ Lookin’ for a bond lawyers wanna tax/ Purple hair got them f****ts on your back Listen to the track below:
