The pop rapper, Remy Ma, said she was not convinced R Kelly sexually assaulted underage girls in a recent episode of the web series State of culture. Image credit: Emaisgoias Remy said that “rapists are only there for their pleasure and do not eat a** to give the woman pleasure, therefore, the act between R Kelly and those girls wasn’t rape but consensual sex”. About the ages of the girls involved with R Kelly, Remy pointed out that there are sixteen years old who are attracted to a thirty years old man so it isn’t unusual for underage girls to want a older man-R Kelly. Remy said that although R Kelly got acquitted he is been treated like he’s a monster. The rapper comments about R.Kelly has caused outrage on various social media platforms since the release of the interview.
