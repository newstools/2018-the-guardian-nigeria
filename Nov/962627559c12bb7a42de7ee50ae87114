Kim Kardashian West received a lot of backlash from the special needs community for using the r-word to insult Halloween party guests who couldn’t guess her costume. Kim dressed up as Pam Anderson to attend Kendall Jenner’s Halloween bash but was jokingly irritated when she quizzed guests about her costume and they couldn’t figure it out. In a video, Kim posted which has been since deleted on her Instagram page of her using the r-word to describe guests who were too dumb to decipher her Halloween character. Image credit: TMZ Special needs groups have spoken out about the dangers of using the r-word because it essentially uses a serious condition as an insult. The internet backlash was immediate after the video was posted which led to her deleting the video from her page. In response to the outrage, Kim said “I want to apologize for what I said in a recent video post that is inappropriate and insensitive to the special needs community. I try to learn from my mistakes and this is one of those times. Please know that my intention is always pure, and in this case, it was a mistake. I’m sorry.”
