It appears that on and off couple, Rihanna and Hassan Jameel can’t just do without each other as the lovebirds were spotted together on what appeared to be a romantic date on November 27. 30-year-old Rihanna had dinner with Jameel at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica causing many to believe that the two are back together. Considering this is also the first time they have been spotted together in public, it has many believing that they have reignited their flame. During the said dinner date, they were reportedly “surrounded by bodyguards and entered the restaurant’s private room through the back door, before spending three hours at dinner.” Although photographers didn’t snap Jameel as he arrived, they were able to catch a glimpse of Rihanna. The Diamonds hitmaker was seen wearing a black coat, and a gold necklace, as she stepped foot into the eatery. According to a report by HollywoodLife, sources close Rihanna told the publication that, “Rihanna likes Hassan a lot, so it was easy for her to hook up with him again a few times over the holidays,” the source shares. “She even thought she was in love with him before their busy schedules interfered with their passionate relationship. Rihanna still sees Hassan when she can, and when they do, the spark is still there,” they add. “Rihanna and Hassan have amazing chemistry and she is not ready to let go of him completely.” It would be recalled that just some days ago, Rihanna appeared to throw shades at her ex, Chris Brown when he dropped a shook emoji on a lingerie photo of her on Instagram.
