•Plans to feast on Oshiomhole’s bribery saga
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday alleged that “the Muhammadu Buhari presidency has again disgraced our nation by stealing the Rex Institute’s ‘Next Level’ logo and mantra as its 2019 campaign mantra and presenting it to Nigerians as its idea and creation.” In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP further said: “This revelation has further confirmed that the Buhari presidency lacks integrity as a fraud syndicate that thrives on deception, lies, false performance claims, certificate forgery and corruption while always trying to take credit for the achievement of others. “This shameful plagiarism by the Buhari presidency has further sunk him into self-inflicted public opprobrium, from which he has not recovered since the demonstration by Nigerians, that he does not have his acclaimed WAEC certificate and had to procure an attestation, which Nigerians also discovered to be a forged document.” The PDP said it was not surprised that President Buhari, “in his desperation, can go as low as patronising plagiarism and false credit claims, since it is clear that he lacks the competence to initiate and articulate an original blueprint for leadership; the reason our nation has been in dire strait in the last three and half years.” According to the statement, “President Buhari has over time shown that he cannot be trusted. He heads the most corrupt administration in the history of our nation.” The PDP charged President Buhari to immediately show remorse, apologize to Nigerians and prepare to accept defeat, claiming that “the people are not ready to vote for any leader that has demonstrated a proclivity for falsehood, forgery and incompetence in governance.” Meanwhile, the immediate past Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank, has hinted that the opposition PDP would make an issue out of the allegation of bribe taking levelled against the ruling party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.
