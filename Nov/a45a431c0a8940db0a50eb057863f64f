Etsako Citizens Club has scolded the All Progressives Congress (APC) governors calling for the resignation of the national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. The non-partisan club of Etsako professionals, which Oshiomhole is a member, came to his defence over various allegations against him since the conclusion of party primaries. Some of the allegations include non-compliance with party guidelines, imposition and substitution of names of candidates to the detriment of some governors, state party chairmen, political godfathers and the National Working Committee (NWC). In a statement to The Guardian, the club expressed anger that Oshiomhole was singled out for prosecution for upholding the provisions of the partyâ€™s constitution and electioneering guidelines. It, therefore, urged President Muhammadu to urgently call the Department of State Services (DSS) to order and allow the rule of law prevail in the investigation by the appropriate agencies.
