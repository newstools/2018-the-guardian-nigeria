The Confederation of African Football Friday stripped Cameroon of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations hosting rights due to delays in preparing for the continental showpiece. “Today we took the decision to withdraw the 2019 CAN from Cameroon,” CAF president, Ahmad Ahmad, said in a statement. Ahmed was speaking after a 10 hour CAF executive meeting held behind closed doors in the Ghanaian capital. Ahmad said “a task force” would be set up to launch an appeal for offers “to determine a new organising country between now and the end of the year”. South Africa and Morocco are two frontline contenders to step in as hosts in place of Cameroon, who won the last edition in 2017 in Gabon. The newly expande24-team tournament will kick-off June 2019.
