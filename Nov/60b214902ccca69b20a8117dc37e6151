Defending Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich remain the after posting record revenues for the 2017/18 season. Bayern, chasing a seventh straight league title sit fifth in the Bundesliga table, trail leaders Borussia Dortmund by seven points, but are in rude health off the pitch. The total of 657.4 million euros ($752m) is a new peak for the FC Bayern Munich group and subsidiaries. It includes 624.3 million euros generated by the club alone. Dortmund is Germany’s second richest club, reporting income of 536 million euros in August – a figure boosted by the sales of Ousmane Dembele to Barcelona and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal. “FC Bayern Munich can once again be very pleased with the financial results of the 2017/2018 financial year,” said chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. “As well as the sporting success of last season, where we won the Bundesliga and reached the latter stages of the Champions League, these results are the evidence that FC Bayern also had a good year on the financial front. “Since the club’s professional football section was established as ‘FC Bayern Munich AG’ in 2002, revenue has increased by 355 percent from 176 million euros to 624 million euros.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
