He said the state government would not relent in its efforts to ensure that all killer diseases that affect children were eradicated from communities in the state. “We have showed enough commitment in this regard, but we must ensure that our children are healthier, protected and developed. “Our children are our future; we will do everything humanly possible to combat any disease that will cripple their bright future,’’ he said. Aliero commended the people of the state for the support they gave polio immunisation programmes. He also called on them to ensure that they adequately patronise health facilities in the state, saying that health facilities were built for thecommon good of the people of the state. Also speaking, the Director of Information, Alhaji Garba Hamisu, appealed to journalists to assist in disseminating health information to the public as part of their corporate responsibilities in promoting the health sector in the state. “Disseminate information that will promote the quality of health of our children and also promote partnership with sponsors,’’ he said.
