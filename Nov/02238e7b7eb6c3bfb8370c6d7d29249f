In case fans are still wondering if actor and singer, Jaden Smith meant his words when he said rapper, Tyler, The Creator is his boyfriend, Smith has reconfirmed their relationship. The Get Down actor confirmed that he and the Flower Boy rapper are indeed an item. The 20-year-old Jaden reconfirmed their relationship during a November 17 episode of his Apple Music Beats 1 Radio show MSFTS FREQUENCY. According to Just Jared. Jaden was discussing The Sunset Tapes: A Cool Tape Story, his new mixtape that was released on that same day when he cleared the ambiguity surrounding his relationship with the 27=year=old Tyler. It would be recalled that the Jaden+Tyler talk started during Tyler’s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival in LA earlier in November. Jaden grabbed the mic and admitted that, “Tyler is my mother*cking boyfriend” to roughly 50,000 people. “Tyler The Creator is my f–king boyfriend. If you take anything away from this f–king show, that’s what you take away!” Later, Jaden would tweet that, “Yup [Tyler] I told Everyone You Can’t Deny It Now.” It is noteworthy that Tyler, The Creator has come under fire for using homophobic slurs during his Odd Future days, the hip-hop collective included members like Frank Ocean who came out as bisexual and Syd The Kyd, who has never shied away from her sexuality. Tyler seemingly hinted that he might not be completely heterosexual on his 2017 album, Flower Boy. Jaden on his part is a vocal advocate for non-gender confirming attitudes ever since he wore a dress for Vogue Korea in 2016. Read More: Jaden Smith And Tyler The Creator Dating?
