Taekwondo and Karate are the martial arts crucial to the success of the second Ministry of Interior Games (MIGA), which will hold later this month. Also considered key in the games is swimming, which the main organising committee (MOC) said was the aquatic sport to focus on in its internal security mechanism. Speaking on the preparations for the MIGA, Secretary to the Board of Civil Defence, Fire, Immigration and Prison Services, Ministry of Interior (CDFIPB), Mallam Al-Hassan Yakmut told The Guardian in Abuja at the weekend that plans had reached the advanced stage for the event billed for Kaduna from November 22 to December 1. Yakmut, a former volleyball star, said 13 different sports, including Tug-of-war, would offer medals to the participants. According to Yakmut, the MIGA is aimed at providing a platform for the Ministry of Interior to support sports development in the country. “Volleyball is there, because I have not forgotten my history,” Yakmut said. Aside taekwondo, karate, tug-of-war and swimming, Yakmut said football, athletics, basketball, badminton, tennis, squash, handball and table tennis were also listed to feature at the MIGA in Kaduna. “It is expected that for the Services to effectively carry out their multilateral internal security mechanism, the security operatives should be competent and skillful in martial arts and swimming. Swimming is very critical to us, especially under this condition of climate change and rising level of water,” Yakmut said. The Services participating in the MIGA are the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Nigeria Prisons Service (NPS), Federal Fire Service (FFS) and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).
