The dollar changed hands at 113.02 yen in Asian trade, barely changed from 113.04 yen in New York but was up from 112.82 yen late Tokyo time on Wednesday. On Wall Street, share prices recovered as the technology sector ended a two-day haemorrhage, although analysts said the respite may be temporary. “Japanese shares are supported by the halt in falls in US shares and a cheaper yen against the dollar,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, senior market analyst at Monex. “Institutional investors are in a strong wait-and-see attitude” ahead of three days of holidays in Japan, Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online Securities, said in a commentary.
