A doctor at the hospital informed The Guardian that Akpana was rushed to the hospital semi-unconscious. Upon examination, the doctor said her blood pressure is elevated at 190/115 mmHg. He confirmed that Akpanaâ€™s blood glucose was normal but revealed that she may be suffering from a Transient Ischeamic Attack (TIA).
