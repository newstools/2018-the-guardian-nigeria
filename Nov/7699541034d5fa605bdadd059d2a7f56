Analysts at Cordros Capital said: “Again, we reiterate our negative outlook for the equities market in the short to medium term, amid growing political concerns ahead of 2019 elections and absence of a positive market trigger.

Afrinvest Securities Limited said: “Despite the overall negative performance this week, we noticed increased buying activity in bellwethers and we expect this trend to be sustained in the coming week, as investors seek to lock-in on the current attractive pricing in the market.

However, we expect the current bargain hunting noticed majorly on bellwether banking stocks to continue in the next trading week due to their current cheap prices and huge upside potential. “  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
