The applicants are asking the court to declare that the military operations violate their fundamental human rights to life, dignity of human person, personal liberty, family and private life and therefore illegal. They also prayed for a declaration that operation Python Dance 111 in the South East is a violation of the rights of the Nigerian public resident in the area and therefore Undemocratic and unconstitutional. In addition, the applicants want the court to declare that maintenance of law and order and the enforcement of law in Nigeria is the primary and constitutional responsibility of the Nigeria Police Force and not the Nigeria Armed forces. They therefore, prayed the court to order the defendants to evacuate the military from the zone as well as an order mandating the Police to take charge of enforcement of law and order in those zones. Omirhobo also asked for a perpetual injunction, restraining the president and other defendants from using armed forces to perform the duties of the Police.
