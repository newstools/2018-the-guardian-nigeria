Officials of the Nigerian Army on Saturday were caught on camera  shooting sporadically and assaulting traders at CMS area of Lagos Island. Eyewitnesses alleged some persons in the area had earlier ganged up to beat up a military officer which spurred a retaliation from the soldiers. “Soldiers stormed CMS shooting sporadically and beating both traders and passersby. It was alleged that some guys beat up a soldier there and the latter called for reinforcement,” an eyewitness said. The reported sporadic shooting and assault on the traders caused huge panic as other traders have fled their wares while motorists and pedestrians were also being assaulted. An eyewitness who pleaded anonymous expressed disappointment in the manner at which the Army had reportedly taken their supposed “revenge” on some offenders. “It’s sad to know that the people that are meant to protect us are the same people that victimize helpless citizens on the slightest provocation,” the source said.
