A British woman, who has stated her name as Jane Doe, has accused Nelly of sexual assault. She claims that he propositioned her in an inapproriate and disturbing gesture afer he had asked her to stay behind after a meet and greet.
The document reportedly states that she refused his advances and he masturbated infront of her and made other sexual and obscene remarks. According to her she had told him: “You may have more quid in your bank than I do. But this doesn’t make you any more special. Pull your trousers back up and fuck off.” She also stated that he reportedl forced his erection into her mouth and she jumped back and managed to escape. Essex police confirmed that ‘criminal enquiries are still ongoing in relation to the sexual assault’. The alleged victim is seeking an unstated damages.
The Jane Doe had initially made no report to the police but was cited in a US case made by Monique Greene, a 22 year old who claimed that “Nelly preyed on fans.” Greene had claimed that she was raped in October 2017 on his tour bus, although the two had reached an agreement that the case will be dismissed. At the time Nelly said: “The truth will come out, and I will be vindicated. These types of false allegations undermine real claims of sexual abuse/harassment by real victims. ‘I do NOT plan on walking away quietly. I have to speak up for my family and for the real victims strong enough to come forward and face people that have actually assaulted them,” in response to the suit
