As parts of efforts to strengthen professional boxing in Nigeria, organisers of the GOtv Boxing Night have included US-based Nigerian pugilist, Oluwafemi ‘The Eagle’ Oyeleye among those on international clashes billed for December 28 at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos. The Nigerian, who is making waves in his professional boxing career in the United States of America, will take on Meshack ‘Smart Boy’ Mwankemwa of Tanzania in a middleweight challenge. The 17th edition of GOtv Boxing Night will be headlined by the World Boxing Federation (WBF) Intercontinental super featherweight bout between Nigeria’s Seun Wahab and Tanzania’s Issa ‘Peche Boy’ Nampepeche. The organisers made the disclosure in Lagos yesterday. The WBF Intercontinental super featherweight clash entitles to the winner to take a shot at the WBF world title in the division. Also scheduled to be in action is crowd favourite, Olaide ‘Fijaborn’ Fijabi, who will face Yusuf Mufutau in a light welterweight challenge contest. Fights on the card also include national lightweight challenge duels between African Boxing Union champion, Oto ‘Joe Boy’ Joseph and Hammed ‘Ese’ Hammed Ganiyu; Rilwan ‘Real One’ Oladosu against Mubarak Hamzat; and Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola against Nurudeen ‘Prince’ Fatai.
