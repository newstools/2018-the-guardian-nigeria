The Falcons had earned $3,000 for a win in the group phase but were earmarked for $5,000 each for victory in the final. The Guardian learnt yesterday that the NFF, which commended the lofty commitment, dedication and resilience the players have displayed so far in the championship, decided to dangle the sum of $10,000 for each players, as against the $5,000 it earlier promised, if they retain the Cup tomorrow. Meanwhile, the two captains, Onome Ebi and Rita Chikwelu have on behalf of the team expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari and loving Nigerians at home and in the diaspora for their support to the team. They pledged that they would overcome the Banyana Banyana in tomorrow’s final in order to return to Nigeria with the trophy. Ebi said: “We have the World Cup ticket now, which was always our first target here. The second is winning the Cup for a third successive time and ninth time overall. It is a mission we are determined to accomplish on Saturday.” Nigeria defeated South Africa 2-0 in the final of the second edition of the competition in Johannesburg in 2000, to retain the Cup they had won at the inaugural edition in Nigeria two years earlier.
