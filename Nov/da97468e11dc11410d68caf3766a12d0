Singer Shawn Mendes and model, Hailey Baldwin (now Hailey Bieber) sparked relationship rumours about six months ago when they walked 2018 Met Gala red carpet together. The two repeatedly denied being an item at the time but in a shocking interview with Rolling Stones, Mendes has revealed that they once shared a romance after all. In the Rolling Stone interview, he said, “I don’t even wanna put a title on it. I think it was more of a zone of limbo,” he says of their time together. It is noteworthy that this relationship was just two months before her whirlwind engagement to Canadian music sensation, Justin Bieber. On this timeline, Mendes said, “I get it, you know,” he continued in the interview. “I texted Hailey, ‘Congratulations,’ and I really am happy for them. She’s still one of the fu**ing coolest people ever — she’s not just a beashawnutiful person visually, but she’s one of the most beautiful hearts I’ve ever met,” he added.

But you can’t control your heart,” he also said in the interview.  It would be recalled that Baldwin’s husband, Bieber recently confirmed their marriage while she has since changed her name to Hailey Bieber on Instagram.
