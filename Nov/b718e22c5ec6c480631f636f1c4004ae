 Bamanga Tukur  Former National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and African Business Roundtable Forum, Alhaji Bamanga Tukur, has endorsed the candidature of former Vice President and PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, saying: “Nigerians have no better alternative to Atiku’s presidency.” Tukur, who spoke to journalists yesterday in Yola, said Atiku, as former vice president and a successful businessman, “understands the economic needs of Nigerians more than other contestants that know nothing about running a business.” He said: ” Politics is good for business and business is good for politics. Both private and public sectors work together for the development of a country. If we have a successful businessman and successful politician like Abubakar as president, he can handle both politicians and businessmen very well, because he belongs to both sectors. Those that wish Nigeria well should vote for Abubakar,” He stated that the country needs someone that can unite Nigerians and form his cabinet on merit, not on sentimental grounds, so that Nigeria can operate as an indivisible entity. On the privatisation of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), he said it is the right decision to ensure that fuel scarcity comes to an end and individuals no longer divert revenue from the oil sector.
