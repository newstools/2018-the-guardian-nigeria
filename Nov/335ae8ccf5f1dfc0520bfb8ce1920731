The book written by Mr. Patrick Nzechukwu, is part of the goals to realise vision 2030 of institutionalising internal auditing as a foremost tool for anti-corruption, anti-wastes, inefficiencies, ineffectiveness and non financial risk in West Africa, starting with Nigeria. The launch is scheduled for November 27, 2018 at the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, Lagos. The keynote speaker would be the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, while the book reviewer; a Professor of Accounting and Quantitative techniques at Babcock University, Ogun State, would be Enyi Patrick Enyi. The special guest of honour is the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah. Ohuabunwa said: “Regrettably, the profession has been neglected in West Africa, Nigeria in particular, both at the tertiary institutions and professional levels, including those in practice, despite over 50 years of professionalism of accountancy in Nigeria. “The book will encourage professional Institutions in West Africa to incorporate Internal auditing in their syllabus, and encourage tertiary institutions to include it in their syllabuses as done in other organised economies. It would also make it possible to embark on research and development that would bring about inventions and innovations that are acceptable as global best practices.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
