Photo credit: Guardian Nigeria  Parading the suspects yesterday, the state Commissioner of Police, Johnson Kokumo, said the “offence contravenes the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Act,” which criminalises the sale of  Nigerian currency. Kokumo warned bankers partnering with the traders to desist from such act as the police would not relent in their effort to rid the state of persons dealing in the illicit business. ‘ In carrying out this order, the Nigeria Police, Edo State Command and the Department of the State Security Service (DSS) Benin, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) engaged in an operation aimed at reinstalling illicit sale of the country’s currency notes. “During the exercise  the police  arrested  eight suspects (six males and two females).  The sum of N12 ,580,235 was recovered  from the suspects.” Meanwhile, the CBN recently placed a ban on spraying money at parties, saying that “anyone caught in the act  would pay a fine of N50,000 or risk six months’ imprisonment.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
