Screen star, Rita Dominic was recently a celebrity guest on TVC’s ‘Your View’, and the multiple award-winning Nollywood actress opened up on her struggle of getting married even though she almost got hitched to someone but it turned out sour. The 43-year-old disclosed that she almost got married at some point in her life, adding that she is happy the marriage did not work out. According to Dominic, when in a relationship, couples should at best find a way to live with each other, instead of trying to change negative traits, adding that a grown man cannot change. “I almost married someone. We were there. We were at that point. It didn’t work out and I’m happy it didn’t work out because I saw the signs. “You know how you see the signs and you just ignore it hoping the person will change. Look, a grown man and a grown woman cannot change. They can find a way to live with each other and respect each other’s feelings, but to change a grown person is difficult” she said. When asked by the show’s host, Tope why “we feel that a woman’s success isn’t complete until she’s married and with children, that what has been the pressure concerning being married and why hasn’t it happened?”, Rita replied; “At the end of the day, if I’m going to do it, I’m doing it for myself not that the society wants me to do it. I always will still say; I will marry the man of my dreams and not the man the society dreams for me. “Society feels there’s something wrong with you if you’re a certain age and you’re not married. What if it’s the society something is wrong with? For forcing someone to do what they don’t want to do?” Watch the video below:  Rita Dominic is one of Africa’s most successful actresses and her talent has gained her global recognition.
