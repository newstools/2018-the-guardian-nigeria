British singer Ed Sheeran who is undoubtedly one of the biggest music acts in the world today was just a teenager when classmate Stuart Dines, died on a school trip 12 years ago at the age of 14. This tragedy proved to be the launch of Ed Sheeran’s career as the 27-year-old singer poured his grief of his friend dying in the tragic car crash into the song that launched his music career. It is reported that in the midst of his pain, Ed, who was not on the trip at the time, decided to write down his feelings, penning the song We Are which became one of his most popular songs when he started gigging around London. An excerpt from the book Ed Sheeran by Sean Smith obtained by The Mirror, reads: “Ed had to come to terms with the death of someone he saw practically every day. He resolved to write a song about his feelings. He composed it, he said, ‘whilst I got round to actually accepting it’.” The moving lyrics include: ‘Leaves have fallen to the ground/ And now there’s no one else around/ To hear the cry. ‘I saw your body /I saw your face/ Loss of presence/ Loss of grace/ Behind those eyes.
He goes on to sing: ‘I miss your laughter / I miss your tears/ I miss your rambling /About your fears /Your smile/ The crowed has gathered /All around/ No ones speaking/ No one makes a sound /And I…/ And we break down. ‘ The Grammy award-winning Ed Sheeran began recording music in 2004, and independently released his first collection of work, Spinning Man.
