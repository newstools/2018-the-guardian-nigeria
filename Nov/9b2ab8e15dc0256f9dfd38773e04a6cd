Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said the opposition People’s Democratic Party, PDP, left the country in ruins after ruling the country for 16 years. Speaking at a meeting with a select group of South-east leaders, Buhari criticised the previous administrations for “lack of conscience” while “vandalising” the country. “The state of infrastructure we inherited was terrible – no roads, the railway was killed and power,” said Buhari. “They lacked conscience because anybody with conscience will not do what they did.” Buhari, who will seek re-election in February, said “anybody” could be given the chance to lead the country but not the camp of the PDP because they were reckless with the country’s resources. “Let anybody lead this country but not the PDP. They were so reckless with the resources of the country,” the President said. “If you ruin the economy, send your children abroad to get education, won’t they come back?” he asked, adding: “I said it 30 years ago that this is the only country we have.” The president said the ruling All Progressives Congress got it right from the very beginning that the major problems facing the country were mainly on security, corruption and the economy. In 2015, Buhari wooed voters with his promises to lift the nation’s troubled economy, end decades of corruption and win the war against insurgency. But three years after, critics and opposition condemned his administration stating that it has failed to uphold his promises to improve the country’s economic growth. Recently, a report by Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization in USA, put Nigeria atop the world poverty statistics ahead of India. Buhari, however, said “we must stay here and salvage it together.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
