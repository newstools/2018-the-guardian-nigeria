 Cross River State governor, Senator Ben Ayade  Akpana, an Executive Protocol Officer to Ayade, was said to have collapsed at her apartment at about 2.15pm and was rushed semi-unconscious to a private hospital in Zone 3 area of the FCT by her friend. Dr. Uzochukwu Chibuzor who attended to her informed The Guardian that Akpana was rushed to the hospital semi-unconscious. Upon examination, Chibuzor said her blood pressure was elevated at 190/115 mmHg. He confirmed that Akpanaâ€™s blood glucose was normal but revealed that she might be suffering from a Transient Ischeamic Attack (TIA). To determine if there was any brain injury, the patient had been sent for emergency CT brain scan as at the time of the report. Her friend who rushed her to the hospital told The Guardian that Akpana had been stressed and depressed for some time. The two-time beauty Queen who represented Nigeria and Africa between 2014 and 2015 was said to have been withdrawn to herself lately before the incident.
