The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun state, Dapo Abiodun, has chosen Noimot Salako-Oyedele as his running mate in the 2019 gubernatorial election. Abiodun announced Salako-Oyedele as his choice for deputy governorship candidate in a statement issued by his campaign organisation. He said Salako-Oyedele emerged after a “detailed screening of various qualified individuals” for the position. Abiodun disclosed that Salako-Oyedele, a 52-year-old, has proven her worth professionally with over 30 years of consulting and contracting in the real estate sectors. The campaign organisation said Salako-Oyedele, who is the managing director/chief executive officer, Glenwood Property Development Company Limited, holds a Masters degree in Public Health Engineering from the Imperial College of Science & Technology London, UK. The governorship candidate noted he was “convinced that Mrs. Salako-Oyedele is suitable for this position, given her proven integrity, professional track records, leadership skills and capabilities.” “I look forward to working with her to deliver good governance to the good people of our dear state,” Abiodun said. Abiodun’s emergence as the party’s governorship candidate is against the wish of the state governor Ibikunle Amosun who backs Adekunle Akinladeas his preferred candidate After missing out on the candidacy, Akinlade left the APC to join the Allied People’s Movement (APM).
