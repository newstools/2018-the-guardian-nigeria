 [FILE PHOTO] Adams Oshiomhole,  APC leader  “I challenge Saraki to mention one name of an aspirant that gave money to the national chairman or we file a legal action against him,” Chief Press Secretary to the national chairman, Simon Ebegbulem, said in a statement on Thursday. Saraki on Wednesday said Oshiomhole has no moral right to remain in office nor politics after allegations of corruption levelled against him. Some aggrieved stakeholders of the APC have filed a series of petitions against its national chairman alleging that Oshiomhole collected bribes to award the party’s tickets to the highest bidder during its primaries. Oshiomhole said the attack by Saraki is “unwarranted, pathetic and irresponsible.” The duo have been in battle since the defection of Saraki from the APC to the opposition People’s Democratic Party last July. After his defection, Oshiomhole was particularly vociferous in his threat to ensure Saraki was impeached as the Senate president if he did not resign. The Chairman again said, “Saraki, a usurper of and pretender to the position of Senate president, had no moral ground to call for the resignation of the national chairman”. “It is equally sad, but not unexpected, that Saraki, who is politically drowning, would make such libelous comments against the national chairman of the APC.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
