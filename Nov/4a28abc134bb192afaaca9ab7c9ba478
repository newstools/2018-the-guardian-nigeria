The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State, Emmanuel Jime, has debunked report of being sponsored by the Meyitti Allah to come and repeal the anti-open grazing law of the state. Jime, who was reacting to several media reports credited to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leadership in Benue yesterday, stated that by such smear campaign on his person, it means the party (PDP) is in panic mode of defeat and all out to tarnish his hard-earned reputation. He said: “We all know that when a lie is told severally, people tend to begin to believe it. I am a true-born Tiv man and my mother is a Tiv as well. I have been Speaker in Benue State and nobody has had any doubt about my origin. “About the anti-open grazing law, in 2011, I was a member of the House of Representatives who discussed Fulani invasion on the floor of the House. Why would I advocate for a solution and then turn around to work against it seven years later.” The governorship candidate, who also denied having a soared relationship with the leader of APC in Benue, George Akume and the leadership of the party in the state, said: ‘’There is nothing about the story. It is not true.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
