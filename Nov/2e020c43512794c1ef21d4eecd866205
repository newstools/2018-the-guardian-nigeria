The opposition People’s Democratic Party has alleged former minority leader, Godswill Akpabio, is behind the controversy rocking the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly. “The whole idea behind the recent onslaught by the Senator Godswill Akpabio’s sponsored sacked members of the state assembly is to cause mayhem, generate tension with a view to make the state ungovernable,” the party’s spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan said on Tuesday. “The former members of the State House of Assembly are back to the Assembly complex this morning with heavily armed Police & thugs. We call on all Nigerians to rise in condemnation of this heinous crime,” he added. In the early hours of Tuesday, the assembly was reportedly locked down by men of Nigeria Police Force for the second time in two weeks. Five recently sacked lawmakers reportedly stormed the House of Assembly with heavily armed policemen and thugs. According to reports, the sacked lawmakers were in possession of the mace and wanted to impeach the speaker, suspend 21 members of the assembly and commence proceedings to impeach the Governor of the state. The plot was, however, foiled by the arrival of Governor Udom Emmanuel and the Speaker Luke Onofiok. The PDP further accused the former governor, Akpabio, of hiring thugs to disrupt the assembly’s Tuesday plenary. “Sen. Godswill Akpabio’s @OfficialAPCNg hired thugs are on rampage at the AKHA. Motorists barred from the State Assembly Complex and cars set ablaze by the thugs,” Ologbondiyan said. ” Nigerians should hold Sen. Akpabio & the APC responsible for these actions,” he added. Akpabio defected to the ruling All Progressives Party in August and has promised to deliver the state to ruling party in the forthcoming 2019 election.
