Sylvester Stallone has said that he is ending the “Rocky Balboa” franchise. He wrote this on his Instagram not once but twice with an image of Michael B. Jordan who stars as Adonis Creed. “I guess this is a pretty significant moment. It was the last night of filming and probably my last privileged time of playing my beloved friend, Rocky,” the 72-year-old action star wrote. “Toward the end the camera gets a little cockeyed but The emotion is there. Thank you for taking the “ Rocky Family “ into your hearts for over four decades.”

I just want to thank everyone around the whole wide World for taking the Rocky family into their hearts for over 40 years. It’s been my Ultimate privilege to have been able to create and play this meaningful character. Though it breaks my heart, Sadly all things must pass… and end. I love you Kind and generous people , and The most wonderful thing of all , is that ROCKY will never die because he lives on in you ….

The film earned him a Best Actor nomination and a screenplay nomination. It, however, clinched Best Picture, Best Director and Best Editing at the Academy Awards. Since then, it has had seven sequels and has made over a billion dollars at the box office.
