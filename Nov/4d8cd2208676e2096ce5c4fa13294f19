Deadline features stars of Black Panther, Lupita Nyong’o and Michael B. Jordan, and the director of the movie-Ryan Coogler.
In the Deadline interview, Michael Jordan said”I know what oppression feels like. I know what that is. Maybe we’re not so different(Kilmonger and I). I think that’s one of the biggest takeaways from the movie. To bring humanity to somebody who was constantly looked at as not human.” Lupita shared on Deadline that “One man in his 60s turned to her and said, ‘I am so mad because I didn’t know I needed that: a reflection of myself.’ It was such powerful validation to so many, including me, who worked on it(Black Panther).”   The new #AwardsLine Magazine issue is out!
