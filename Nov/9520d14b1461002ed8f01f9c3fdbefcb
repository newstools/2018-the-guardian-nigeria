Popular Nigerian singer Banky W has joined the growing list of Nigerian entertainers to delve into politics. The award-winning singer took to his Instagram page yesterday, November 10 to reveal his intention to run for political office. He made the revelation at an event in Lagos when he disclosed that will be running for the Federal House of Representative under Modern Democratic Party. Banky W wrote on his Instagram page; Banky W | Instagram “They said we don’t have the money to run.. we say we our strength lies in our numbers. They said we don’t have the structure, we say we will attempt to build it. They said “what if you lose”? I say, what if we win? You see, my entire life has been a story of just dreaming dreams, praying about those dreams, setting goals, and working until they come true. I can live with trying and failing. I can not live with not trying. So while we may not have a godfather, we do have God. And we have vision. And intellectual capacity. And integrity. And the right intentions. And last but not least, a whole lot of hope. At the end of the day, hope may be all we have, but I believe that it is all we need. Thank you and God bless Nigeria.”
