Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun’s anointed successor, Adekunle Akinlade, has defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Allied People’s Movement (APM). This is coming a month after Muhammad Ndabawa-led APC electoral committee in October, declared Dapo Abiodun winner of the direct governorship primary of Ogun APC for the 2019 gubernatorial election as against the wish of Amosun. While the party had been in crisis following adoption of Akinlade as a consensus governorship candidate by the Amosun-led faction of the party ahead of next year’s governorship election, grievances from the party’s primary election remains unsettled. Although the governor and other members of his faction moved for an indirect primary election mode, but five APC aspirants rejected the indirect primary mode. APC’s National Working Committee (NWC) adopted the direct primary election mode instead. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
