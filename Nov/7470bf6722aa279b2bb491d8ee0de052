Georgia Oboh Begins campaign in Cote d’Ivoire this weekend
Georgia Oboh, who joined the professional ranks last week, is determined to complete her studies despite the demands of her new status. The 17-year-old Oboh became the first Nigerian female teenager to enter the professional golf train on November 11. She is debuting in the professional ranks at the 20th Cote d’Ivoire Open Championship, which teed off yesterday in Abidjan. Oboh explains that she would dedicate her first three years as a professional to learning the ropes in the paid ranks, while completing her PGA studies. The girl, who made history as the first Nigerian girl to feature in the Youth Olympics at the Buenos Aires 2018 Games, is on the Ladies Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (LPGAN) scholarship, where she is being trained by Uloma Mbuko, a premier Lady Grade A PGA of South Africa golf professional. Mbuko is excited to have Oboh in her wings and believes the Edo-born athlete has a bright future in the sport. “I am so pleased to see Georgia Oboh join the professional ranks and I am sure she will do great due to the extensive support she has in her team, her experience and willingness to work hard. “She made the decision based on her lifelong desire to play professional golf but waited to compete for Nigeria in the Youth Olympics as she had committed late last year. We, the board at the LPGAN are looking forward to a long and successful career with Georgia,” Mbuko enthused. On why she picked November 11 as the day to join the professional ranks, Oboh explained on her Instagram and Twitter handles, that the date is celebrated as Remembrance Day in her country of birth, United Kingdom, as well as the United States. “This day is marked for the rise of African American slave, Nat Turner, who has been credited with inspiring African Americans nationwide using his Christian faith as a preacher.
