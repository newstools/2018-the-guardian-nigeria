A Federal High Court in Abuja Wednesday ruled against a no-case submission filed by the founder of Daar Investment and Holdings Company Limited Raymond Dokpesi, over an alleged N2.1 bn fraud received from the Office of the National Security Adviser in 2015. “I hereby strike out the application,” the Judge John Tsoho said in court on Wednesday. Dokpesi, who is also the founder of African Independent Television (AIT) and Ray Power Radio, is facing trial for the alleged diversion of N2.1 billion received from the office of former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki. On May 28, the AIT proprietor told the court that he would be making a no-case submission end his trial after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) closed its corruption case against him. He also denied the the allegations against him and accused the federal government of defamation of character. The Judge, however, has insisted that the defendant would have to explain to the court his own side of the matter. Tsoho, therefore, adjourned the matter to February 20 and 21 next year for the continuation of trial. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
