 [FILE] Benin City, Edo State. PHOTO: getgripng.com  Edo State Commissioner for Health, Dr. David Osifo, who reacted on the outbreak of the strange disease in the communities, dispelled the fears that it might either be Lassa fever or Ebola, but said it was rather a suspected case of Yellow fever. However, sources disclosed that the strange ailment has claimed the lives of local resident in Igieduma, Ehor and other neighbouring villages that are mainly agrarian communities. The source, which pleaded anonymity, said at least two persons, including a man said to be in his 70s, have allegedly died in Igieduma village as a result of the strange ailment. The source added that the victim exhibited symptoms suspected to be associated with lassa fever which include high fever, stomach pains, vomiting, nose bleeding. The outbreak of suspected case of lassa fever has heightened fears among residents in the area who are now living in panic and keeping away from close contact with others to avoid transmitting or contracting the strange ailment. Osifo said the state’s Ministry of Health Disease Control team was on the alert to ensure that the affected area is adequately managed. The short message (SMS) from Osifo read in part, “You are correct. We suspected yellow fever; two have been confirmed as yellow fever and negative for lassa. My team of experts is right there now to contain it. Nothing to panic the public.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
