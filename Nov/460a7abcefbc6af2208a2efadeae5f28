 [FILE PHOTO] Re-elected NFF President, Amaju Pinnick.  Speaking at the maiden Grassroots Soccer Talent Hunt organised by the Social Democratic Party candidate for Kogi Central Senatorial District, Pinnick said his second tenure in office would be utilized to grow Nigerian football economy, saying the federation had been hampered by lack of innovative strategies to make the game more viable economically. “We are coming out with a new innovation which will make football an integral part of the Nigerian economy,” he said. He said football administrators were not politicians hence their belief in the unity of Nigeria, adding, “the North Central Zone gave me 95 per cent of their votes so when I wanted to embark on my first official outing, I told them wherever they invited me I would be there. So when I was invited to this event, I had to call the chairman of Kogi State Sports Federation to seek for clearance.” He predicted that the grassroots soccer talent hunt would rejuvenate football in Kogi and Ebiraland, saying, “I want to come here next year and I believe that in two years time some of your players would be in the U-17 and U-20 national teams as well as the Super Eagles.” Also speaking at the event, the organiser of the tournament, Natasha Akpoti said she decided to start the talent hunt to help the many talented youths in Kogi State actualize their dream. “It might interest you to know that every evening young boys and girls take over all the fields across Kogiland to exhibit amazing skills, but they don’t have the opportunity to take their game beyond their communities. It is because of them and many others that this dream is coming true today.” At the event were football scouts and coaches led by former Super Eagles’ star, Daniel Amokachi.
