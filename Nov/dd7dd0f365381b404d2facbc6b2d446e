 [FILE PHOTO] Buhari  The PDP, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said: “The attempt by the Buhari Presidency to lure the South-East geo-political zone into supporting his second term fell like a pack of cards as the people have resolved not to follow any leader who cannot deliver on his promises.” However, the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar, has insisted that restructuring is the only solution to the nation’s development problems. Atiku, who spoke at a symposium organised by the Osasu Show in Abuja, represented by spokesman of his campaign group, Segun Sowumi, also declared that the economy must be opened up to private investors to generate employment, reduce poverty and make life more meaningful for Nigerians. Also at the symposium were other presidential candidates, including presidential candidate of Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Mrs. Obi Ezekwesili, among others, who reeled out their policy directions. Meanwhile, Governor David Umahi and Chairman of South-East Governors’ Forum has said that the zone will vote for any party that takes it serious, saying that it is high time we separate politics from reality. In another development, the PDP in a statement by Ologbondiyan yesterday has said that the verdict by the former United Kingdom (UK) Secretary of State for International Development and member of the UK Parliament, Priti Patel, that the corruption and recklessness of Buhari government is responsible for our economic woes, vindicated our position on the administration. The party stated this in a statement by Ologbondiyan yesterday. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
