French President Emmanuel Macron / STEPHANE DE SAKUTIN / AFP Four people arrested and linked to the French extreme right were on Saturday charged over a suspected plot to attack President Emmanuel Macron during World War I remembrance ceremonies. The four men aged between 22 and 62 appeared before an anti-terrorism judge in Paris and were charged with associating with terrorists and arms possession. They were arrested on Tuesday after one man, living in southeastern France and armed with a knife, travelled to Moselle, eastern France, where he met with three other suspects. At the time, Macron was touring nearby World War I battlefields and meeting with local people.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
