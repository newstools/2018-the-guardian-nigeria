Bobby Brown, musician And Whitney Houston’s ex-husband, has taken the BBC and the Showtime for violating his rights. According to the lawsuit, Bobby Brown and Bobbi Kristina Brown’s estate state that the documentary, Whitney: Can I Be Me shot by Showtime and BBC used a footage from his 2005 reality series Being Bobby Brown. In the documentary, Brown and his deceased daughter take up more than 30 minutes of the time despite not signing any document for the footage. “The footage was actually recorded prior to the divorce in 2007 between Brown and Houston. Brown never signed or executed a release for the airing of the material that appears in the film. The footage of Brown is approximately fifteen (15) years old… Assuming that Plaintiff(s) have proper title to the footage, they do not have proper title to its contents,” the court document reads. Owing to this violation, Brown is demanding for the payment of $2 million (N729,000,000) from Passion Pictures, Tracey Baker-Simmons, Wanda Shelley, B2 Entertainment, Simmons Shelley Entertainment, Showtime and the BBC.
