Peter Okoye, more recently known as Mr P, collaborates with fast-rising Afropop sensation Simi to release a sweet new single titled “Zombie”. Zombie is a soothing mélange of afrobeats and R&B rhythms, with a catchy hook that borrows from Fela’s popular song of the same name. The song was produced by Daihardbeats, and as we listen, Mr P delivers his lyrics in the soft, passionate tone that has thrilled fans over the years, complemented by Simi’s stunning vocals. The story of two lovers unfolds in the video, where we see Mr P and Simi singing their hearts out. Directed by Unlimited L.A., the video is beautiful in its simplicity and allows us to connect with the story and appreciate the declaration of love in pidgin English(who knew pidgin was this romantic). Your Love smooth pass water
Na only you no lie oo
Make this feeling no die
Your touch sweet pass sugar
You make me so happy oo… Check out the song below:
