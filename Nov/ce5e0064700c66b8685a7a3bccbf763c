The bottom line is that we should have a system of law teaching and practice. It is up to the standard of which we are all proud of, and can be defended at any given point,” he said. Dalhatu said: “As professionals, you must apply wisdom and the courage to refuse to act for a client, when the client’s instructions would cause you to violate the rules of professional conduct. “To this extent, I charge you all to be conversant with the provisions of the rules to avoid practices that go foul to the rules.“Where a complaint is made against your conduct in your capacity as a legal practitioner, the alleged offence would be put side by side the provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), to see if there is a prima facie case against you.” He added that once it has been established as such, such person would face a disciplinary committee, which would sanction the person accordingly.
