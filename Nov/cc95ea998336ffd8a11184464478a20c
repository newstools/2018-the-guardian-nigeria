According to a report by Page Six, award-winning actress and singer, Jennifer Lopez has gotten involved in the ongoing child support negotiation of her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez. Rodriguez who has two daughters with his ex, Cynthia is currently in the midst of child support negotiations and Lopez who also has two children of her own with ex, Marc Anthony decided to attend a between both parties on September 13th. The 49-year-old On the Floor singer was also reportedly not shy to get involved. Sources told the outlet that ‘J-Lo’s presence blindsided Cynthia. Things went from bad to worse when Lopez allegedly suggested that Rodriguez should only pay 3.6 million naira ($10,000) in child support a month, instead of the approximately 36 million naira ($100,000) he has been paying. It is also reported that Jenny from the block is not backing down either, and has continued to try to direct the unfortunate situation. “She’s driving the bus,” said one source in regards to Rodriguez’s thoughts on the matter. Although Cynthia and her attorney have declined to comment on the legal proceedings, she did talk to Page Six last week about her relationship with the former ballplayer. She said, “All I can tell you, there’s been a shift, and I’m not sure what to attribute it to” she said, before explaining her concern more fully. “Alex has dated some wonderful women since our divorce, many of whom have had positive relationships with our children,” she said positively. The ball player’s ex then added ominously, “Alex and I have worked well trying to create a stable environment for our daughters and there has never been an issue. Until now.”
