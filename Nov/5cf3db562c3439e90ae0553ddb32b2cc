Olga Diyachenko who is the mother to Super Eagles captain, John Mikel Obi’s twins is currently in Nigeria alongside the football star and their children. A welcome party was held for them with his parents and siblings in attendance. Olga was clearly impressed as she has now poured encomium on Nigerian women. She wrote; The welcome Party | Instagram “Nigeria, what a surprise you’ve turned out be. �� But, if I’m to say what impressed me most, it’s The Women. So much; grace, charisma and not a shred of insecurity. Nigerian women walk swaying their beautiful hips with their backs impeccably straight, heads held high, knowing their worth. Their attitude is strong, yet very sensual, regardless whether it’s a wealthy woman walking through a 5 star hotel or a young girl crossing the road at 7 AM rushing to work. Although may I say, Nigerian women do not rush, nor do they fidget, they simply glide. The way Nigerian women preserve their culture and traditions is admirable. They don’t chase international designers or dress according to Vogue, they wear beautiful traditional dresses, dance the traditional dances and do it all with pride! I hope Ava and Mia will inherit the calmness, sense of pride, posture and self worth that I’ve witnessed Nigerian women posses with such ease. Nigerian Women hat off to you �� #Nigeria #Pride #Women �”
