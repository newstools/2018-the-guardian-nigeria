 [FILE PHOTO] court  The acting spokesman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Tony Orilade, who disclosed this yesterday in a statement issued in Abuja said Jengebe was convicted after the appellate court found him guilty on seven out of the 10 counts for which he was earlier acquitted at the Federal High Court, Gusau, Zamfara State. In the lead judgment of the court read by Justice Habeeb Abiru, the earlier acquittal of the embattled chairman was set aside, Orilade said. According to him, the appellate court held that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt seven out of the ten counts of the money laundering charge brought against Jengebe by the EFCC. He was consequently sentenced to five years imprisonment on each of four of the counts, and seven years each on the three other counts. The court ordered that the sentences shall run concurrently. On the 12th of May 2017, the Federal High Court sitting in Gusau presided over by Justice Z.B Abubakar discharged and acquitted the convict on the 10 counts charge of money laundering but convicted him for engaging in private business while he was still in public service. An offence for which he was never charged for by the commission. Dissatisfied with the judgement of the lower court, the prosecution approached the Court of Appeal seeking it to set aside the judgement of the lower court.
