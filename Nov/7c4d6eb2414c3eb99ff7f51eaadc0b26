Senator Dino Melaye has been appointed as the spokesman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council. PDP announced Melaye’s appointment at the inauguration of its presidential campaign council in Abuja. “Thank you, PDP for my appointment as Director in charge of Civil Societies/ NGO’S and Campaign Spokesperson in the PDP Presidential Campaign. We shall usually overcome. Light will always rejoice over darkness. Power to the People,” Melaye tweeted. The top priority for the council headed by Nigeria’s Senate president Bukola Saraki as the director-general would be to ensure PDP’s presidential candidate and former vice president Atiku Abubakar unseats incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari. The chairman of the opposition party, Uche Secondus expressed optimism in the council’s ability to ensure its return to power after its 16 years rule was halted by Buhari’s election in 2015. “I am confident that this assemblage of capable, courageous and patriotic men and women would lead us successfully to realize this objective of winning the 2019 general elections in order to rescue our dear country from the hands of the failed APC government,” Secondus said. According to him, “If you meet every day with optimism if you confront every obstacle with determination; if you refuse to give up; if you never quit; if you approach every challenge with confidence and pride, no dream would be beyond your reach.” He, therefore, urged to council to surmount its challenges and ensure victory in next year’s election.
