The cook who allegedly murdered a Lagos businessman and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Ope Bademosi, in the early hours of Wednesday 31 October has been arrested by the Ondo State Police Command. The suspect identified as Sunday Afoubhale allegedly killed Bademosi at his residence at Onikoyi Lane, Parkview Estate, Lagos. According to intelligence gathered by The Guardian, the chef, whose name is only identified as Sunday, sneaked into the bedroom of his boss, Bademosi, and stabbed a knife into his heart on Wednesday. Neighbours’ attention was drawn to the murder when a member of the household raised the alarm. The Guardian learnt that the chef gained entry through the kitchen to which he had the keys. Sunday was alleged to have run away after committing the dastardly act. The police thereafter declared him wanted. The suspect’s picture identified was handed over to security agencies in order to identify and track him within the country and at the nations’ borders. However, Ondo State Police spokesperson, Femi Joseph, confirmed the arrest and said the suspect would be paraded today (Friday) at the headquarters of the command. But, prior to his arrest, residents have had similar casualties from foreigners. “This will be the third time we have had Togolese attacks in the estate, and we have had two casualties – Mrs. Adeleke’s daughter last year and this one. Also, we had Fasade’s attempted murder last year. We must implore all residents to desist from hiring these foreign nationals,” a member of the residents’ association stated. A friend to the deceased, who preferred anonymity, said: “A picture of the suspect in military uniform was uncovered after the act. The wife of the deceased went out in the morning before she returned, the man had been killed. Ope is a great loss to us. He opens doors for his friends. We will miss him greatly.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
