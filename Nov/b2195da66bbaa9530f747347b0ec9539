In most cases, we tell ourselves that we can manage our feelings but realize over time that is not possible. Now you are in a bind about what should do with your emotions. Maybe shout out your feelings or hide that burning secret from your bestie. Below are helpful tips on what you should do with your feelings for your bestie: Be honest with yourself Emotions have a way of clouding one’s vision of a certain situation. Now that you have feelings for your friend; you need to ask yourself genuinely what do you want.  Take a risk If you have come to the decision that you want to have a romantic relationship with your friend then the next step is to take a risk. Two scenarios will play out:  Let go After being honest, if you decide you can’t risk your friendship then you have to let go of your feelings. Feelings need time to heal or resolve so you have to be patient with yourself. You can’t unlike a person fast especially if the person is a close pal.  Meet other people Try to mingle with other people and enjoy other relationship. This helps to reduce the sting especially when you have decided to let your feelings go.  Don’t stay offended It is quite easy to stay offended at someone who did not return your feelings. Choose to forgive and move on from bitterness.
