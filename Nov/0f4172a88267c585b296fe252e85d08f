 [FILE PHOTO] Ondo Assembly  Olamide George, who is the current vice president of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), was sworn in as the new speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly yesterday, after 18 members of the house endorsed the impeachment of the former principal officers. George replaced Bamidele Oleyelogun, who was impeached yesterday morning alongside his deputy, Iroju Ogundeji. Speaking with The Guardian shortly after he was sworn in, George said that apart from his primary assignment of lawmaking, he would work closely with those saddled with the responsibility of re-positioning Ondo State in the area of sports. “I have been a sports lover over the years, and I will use my new position as the Speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly to empower the youths, particularly sports men and women. Ondo State is the home of Sports. We will work closely with Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to regain our leadership position in sports. The governor is a sports lover. “From football where we have Sunshine Stars and Sunshine Queens, to athletics, basketball, swimming, judo, weightlifting, table tennis, karate, boxing and squash, we will make our presence felt. Sports is an avenue to empower the youths and take them away from crime. That is what we will do. Team Ondo will storm the forthcoming National Sports Festival in a big way,” George stated. The Guardian recalls that Olamide George was elected by the Congress into the AFN board last year. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
