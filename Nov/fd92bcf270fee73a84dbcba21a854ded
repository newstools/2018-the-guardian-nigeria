The Senior Special Assistant to Lagos State Governor on Sports, Adeboye Anthoney Adeyinka, has revealed that the state government is working hard to ensure that the state host the final group E African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier between the Super Eagles and Seychelles scheduled to hold on March 22. Speaking at a media parley, Adeyinka said the ongoing renovation work at the Teslim Balogun Stadium was to change the artificial tuff to natural grass, which would be completed soon enough to host the qualifier. “The desire of Governor Akinwumi Ambode is to ensure that the Super Eagles are back in Lagos. With the level of work going on at the Teslim Stadium, the target would be achieved. “Lagos is the hub of football and home of the senior national teams. So, we are working round the clock to get the stadium ready before March 2019. The contractors have begun to change the pitch from the artificial turf to grass,” he said. The president of Smart FC then added that, “For the government, the Teslim Balogun Stadium and the National Stadium, Surulere are the base of the Eagles. They can only be compared to the Wembley Stadium in London. “We know the Lagos fans will be happy to see this dream come through and we are not going to relent on our efforts to make the hosting of the qualifier take place. Lagos fans will be delighted to cheer their darling team again after a long time of not playing in Lagos,” he stated.
