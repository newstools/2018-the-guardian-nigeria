Grammy award-winning songstress, Taylor Swift has in times past had a well-publicised love life and even made more so by her choice of singing about it. However, the singer has been keeping her latest flame under wraps as she and current boyfriend, Joe Alwyn have been very private about their affairs. Swift broke that protocol today when she decided to show her supportive side by taking to Instagram to promote the actor’s new film The Favourite. Taking to her Instagram story, she wrote, “The Favourite is phenomenal, you need to see it”. The film focuses on the behind-the-scenes politics between two cousins jockeying to be court favourites during the reign of Queen Anne. In the period-piece, which is set in early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne, played by Olivia Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governs the country in her stead. When a new servant Abagail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. The Favourite hits theatres in the US today, November 23, which will be followed up by the release in the UK January 1, 2019. You can watch the trailer below:  Swift and Alywn have reportedly been dating since September 2016.
