Olajide Omotayo Olajide Omotayo and Bose Odusanya are top seeds of the singles events in the men and women categories of the 50th anniversary Asoju Oba Cup, which kicked off yesterday at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium. Omotayo, winner of the 2013 edition of the champion, will share the same status with the women defending champion Odusanya. While Italy-based Omotayo will contest with 63 others, Odusanya is expected to do battle with 22 players to retain her title after she won it in 2015, 2016 and 2017. However, the 2017 men’s singles runner’s up, David Fayele is seeded number two while Nimota Aregbesola is ranked second best in the women’s cadre. This year’s edition will also see the return of 2013 women’s singles champion, Tolu Durosimi-Etti, who is seeded four in the women’s singles. With the exit of Azeez Solanke, Rilwan Akanbi, Halimot Ayinla for the National Sports Festival, the opportunity is now clear for Odusanya, Omotayo and others to claim the titles. In today’s event, battles in the cadet and junior challenge will begin with Indian Language School and Greensprings School involved for laurels in the categories. Odusanya is, however, optimistic she hope to create a new record by winning her fourth successive title in the championship.
