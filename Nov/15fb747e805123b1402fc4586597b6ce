2018 has been quite a dramatic and eventful year for Selena Gomez. From splitting from The Weeknd to her on and off again lover, Justin Bieber getting married to Hailey Baldwin not to mention Gomez’s emotional breakdown which had her hospitalised. However, like the strong woman she is, Gomez is reportedly getting ready to make a big comeback in 2019. It is learnt that Selenators as she calls her fans can expect new music from the Wolves crooner. Gomez who has avoided the spotlight for the majority of 2018 is said to be hoping to get back to work in the new year, According to a source that spoke with HollywoodLife, “Selena is sitting on a ton of new, unreleased music. She is waiting to be in a place where she feels strong enough physically, emotionally and mentally before she releases any more music or a whole album. Selena knows it will take a lot of energy to support a new album, and even possibly a tour, so she wants to wait until she feels 1000% before sharing more music with her fans. She is hoping 2019 will be a big year for her, a big comeback, with more acting, more music and a return to social media too. She loves and misses her fans and can’t wait to get back to work”. This news is coming on the heels of Gomez’s brand new ad campaign with Puma, which marked her first public endeavour since her September 2018 hospitalisation. Although it is uncertain if the ad was shot before or after her hospitalisation, the Bad Liar singer looked happy and healthy in the video. The ad, which the brand shared on Instagram shows Gomez and a number of other young women sharing some serious inspiration. They take turns talking about what makes them “strong,” and Selena proudly describes herself as a “risk taker.”
