This is no Parent Trap as Hollywood actress, Lindsay Lohan is not shy about getting flirty with rapper, Tyga on Instagram. The Mean Girls star might have taken a cue from Nicki Minaj who also recently shot her shot at Black Panther star, Michael B Jordan at the recently held MTV EMA. Lohan left a comment on 29-year-old Tyga’s selfie in bed and the comment has ignited the internet. Lohan wrote,   Weird flex A post shared by  T-Raww (@tyga) on Nov 17, 2018 at 10:47am PST  “Taste.” Many fans have since freaked out about her comment with many encouraging her to shoot her shot at the Dip rapper. It would be recalled that Tyga’s last known serious relationship was with 21-year-old Kylie Jenner, who is now dating fellow rapper Travis Scott, 26. Tyga on his part has in times past gotten flirty with Iggy Azalea although the duo has never entered into a full-fledged relationship. Meanwhile, Lindsay has been busy filming her reality show, Lohan Beach Club, in Mykonos, Greece. The MTV docuseries is set to premiere in 2019 and will follow Lohan as she works to expand her business empire with the launch of Lohan Beach House.
