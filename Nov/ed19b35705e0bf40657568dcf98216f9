Legendary wrestling star, Hulk Hogan is back as he has made a grand return to the world of WWE ring for the first time since his n-word scandal. The star made his big comeback in Saudi Arabia when he stormed the ring at the ‘Crown Jewel’ pay-per-view event in Riyadh today wearing his signature bandana and a Hulkamania shirt with his signature red and yellow boa. Hulk Hogan who is hosting the event told the crowd, “It’s good to be back!” “It’s awesome to be here back in the WWE,” Hulk continued. He further went on to note how excited he was to get on a plane and fly across the world to make his return. He sent the crowd into a cheer when he said, “So, whatcha gonna do when the power of Hulkamania and the ‘Crown Jewel’ run wild on you, brother?!” Well let me tell you something, BROTHER….@HulkHogan is in the house, and he's hosting #WWECrownJewel! pic.twitter.com/XRSEbW7eRc — WWE (@WWE) November 2, 2018  It would be recalled that WWE had been looking to bring Hulk back into the fold since May but officials were just waiting for the right opportunity. It remains unclear if the plan was to make Hulk a part of ‘Crown Jewel’ all along or if he was a last-minute Plan B after John Cena and Daniel Bryan refused to participate over the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It would be recalled that Hulk Hogan was booted from the WWE in 2015 after a racist n-word rant went public. Hulk apologized and several African-American wrestlers publicly offered their support for Hogan. It is also learnt that WWE was paying close attention to Hulk’s philanthropic work such as his speech at the Boys & Girls Club back in May because they wanted to see how he was received. It remains to be seen if this is a one-time thing or if he will be a reoccurring character in future WWE storylines.
