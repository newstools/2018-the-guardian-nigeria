Executive Director of the foundation, Mr Akin Fadeyi also berated parents who encourage their wards to cut corners so as to reach the top, warning that such children would only end up imbibing destructive social values. This, he noted would further eat deep into the philosophy and moral foundation upon which a good society should be built. He spoke in Lagos at the official media launch of the second season of ‘Corruption Not in My Country’ (CINMC) television drama skit and advocacy radio drama series, sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation. The director, who was represented by Mrs. Obialunanma Nnaobi, explained that the project, targeted at secondary school students, is aimed at spurring the people to take action against corruption, by holding themselves and their leaders accountable. He also noted that AFF aims to use the educative entertainment advocacy against corruption in its current project centred on fighting the menace, “even to the children in their various schools with current number of secondary school students participating in the programme.” Fadeyi noted that dishonesty in many sectors such as education, power and health deserves urgent interventions by the government. The AFF chief said, “ Recently, we discovered sharp practices online in the education sector, we are particularly concerned about the sector because education is the second or third most powerful and effective instrument of socialisation, after family and religion. Therefore, if children and youth are not properly socialised, they may end up imbibing destructive social values. This would no doubt eat deep into the philosophy and moral foundation upon which a good society should ideally be built.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
