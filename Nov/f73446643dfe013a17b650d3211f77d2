China reported its first case in August in northeastern Liaoning province. Since then, the disease has steadily moved south into major pork-producing provinces despite efforts to contain it, including by culling tens of thousands of pigs. The ministries blamed the spread on the flouting of restrictions imposed on moving pigs out of affected areas. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned in August that the disease could spread to other parts of Asia. African swine fever is not harmful to humans but causes deadly haemorrhagic fever in domesticated pigs and wild boar. With no antidote or vaccine, the only known control method is to cull animals. Around half of the world’s pigs are raised in China, and China is the planet’s biggest per capita consumers of pork, according to the FAO.
