Bowen University and Cornfield Group have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to improve teaching and learning, as well as boost technological advancement in all the school’s operations. Speaking to newsmen in Lagos, vice chancellor, Bowen University, Prof. Joshua Ogunwole, expressed happiness with the new partnership, noting that as a faith-based university, they share the same core values with Cornfield Group. “We are a faith-based university building consciousness in the life of students. What we are doing is one of the things that make an institution strong that is the marriage with corporate bodies. We want people that share with our core values that is why this is critical and crucial to us,” he said. Ogunwole noted that technology-based environment can influence critical thinking and promotes innovation. “We are building 288 -bedroom hostel and one of the things we said is that we need it to be technologically inclined, and we need Cornfield to step in, look at what we have on ground and advice us on how to go about it,” the VC added. We expect hitches and with time it will stabilise. We appreciate the friendship. We will make it mutual because that is what makes friendship lasts longer.” On his part, Chief Executive Officer, Cornfield Group, Dr Babatope Agbeyo said the partnership is a journey into a new era because they want technology to be a thing that will drive operations. Agbeyo disclosed that Bowen is not only thinking ahead, it also wants to achieve result. We are signing the dotted lines to be a reference point in years to come even in the life of people not here. It is a sign that people are entrusting us, they can share responsibility with us. We see Bowen as colleague in changing this country.” He continued: “The partnership is a form of internship. Some of their students come here, we expose them to how things are being done; to practical knowledge of what they have learnt theoretically in the university and when they are going back to the university, they are going back prepared for the outside world because they have acquired the academic knowledge and ethical training.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
