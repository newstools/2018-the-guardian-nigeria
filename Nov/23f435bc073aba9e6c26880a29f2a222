Shehu Sani A Senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, Friday, condemned the ruling All Progressives Congress’ move to discourage the United States from lifting an alleged Visa ban imposed on People’s Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar “Telling a foreign country not to grant visa to your fellow citizen on the ground that he is a candidate; and with no ‘proven case of criminal offense ’ or breach of national or international law, is not just an unpatriotic act but a condemnable act,” Sani said twitter on Friday. This is coming less than 24 hours after the federal government told the U.S. to be cautious in granting a visa to Abubakar, in order not to create the impression of endorsing him for the 2019 election. The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, gave the government’s position at an interactive session with media executives in Abuja on Thursday. Mohammed said the government was aware of the move by the former vice president to lobby the U.S. to lift the visa ban imposed on him. “We understand and appreciate the fact that it is the prerogative of the U.S. to grant a visa to anyone who applies.” Lai Mohammed said “However, we want the U.S. to be neutral and be wary of taking any decision that will give the impression that they are favouring or endorsing one candidate over the other,” he added.
