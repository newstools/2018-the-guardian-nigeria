 Liverpool’s German coach Jurgen Klopp looks on prior to the UEFA Champions League Group C football match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Liverpool FC at the Parc des Princes stadium, in Paris, on November 28, 2018.

However, coach Thomas Tuchel had insisted on the eve of the game that the duo would return to the team and they will flank Edinson Cavani in the Paris attack. Brazilian defender Marquinhos will play in central midfield rather than Adrien Rabiot, and Thilo Kehrer starts at right-back with the Belgian international Thomas Meunier missing completely. PSG are a point behind both Liverpool and Napoli in Group C with two games left, meaning a defeat for the French side would knock them out if Napoli win their game against Red Star Belgrade. Having also been declared fit on the eve of the match, Sadio Mane starts with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in attack for Liverpool. Firmino scored a stoppage-time winner when Liverpool beat PSG 3-2 at Anfield in September.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
