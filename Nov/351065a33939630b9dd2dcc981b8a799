For present and future business developments, and improved profitability, organisations would need to explore ‘Connected Factory’ technology, which is the factory of the future. At a one-day workshop organised in Lagos, by BCX, a technology solution provider, which had in attendance experts from Cisco, the forum said there was need to refocus the business growth direction.
 
With targets on manufacturers, BCX said the new trend in manufacturing industry is about connected factory, where information technology (IT) team, and operational technology (OT) team no longer work in silos, but are connected to a single digital space, from where manufacturing processes are controlled and managed from an individual platform.  According to her, Cisco Meraki would enable the easy management of factory operations from a single platform, against the management of factories from different managerial points, thereby reducing operational cost, improving efficiency, and meeting business goals.
