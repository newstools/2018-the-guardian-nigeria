Comic creator, Stan Lee who passed on a few days ago has been blamed for influencing Donald Trump’s victory through (wait for it) his comics. TV presenter Bill Maher wrote in his blog that although he has nothing against comic books, Lee playes a major role in leaving what was meant to be for kids by moving on “to big-boy books without the pictures.” “They didn’t have to give up kid stuff. And so they pretended comic books were actually sophisticated literature,” he wrote. “I’m not saying we’ve necessarily gotten stupider.” “The problem is, we’re using our smarts on stupid stuff.” “I don’t think it’s a huge stretch to suggest that Donald Trump could only get elected in a country that thinks comic books are important,” he adds.
