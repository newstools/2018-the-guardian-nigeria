 The National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) on Thursday in Abuja organised free HIV screening services at Wuse market. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the event was part of NACA’s activities to commemorate this year’s World AIDS Day, with the theme “Know your Status”. Mrs Pauline Tallen, NACA Board Chairperson, while sensitising the public on the need to know their status, noted that it was important to end the epidemic in the country. She said that when people get tested, it would help them live healthy lifestyles as well as getting those who tested positive on life saving treatment. Tallen explained that the World AIDS Day was meant to celebrate those living with the virus and also remember those who might have lost their lives to it. She advised the general public to know their status so that the goal of ending the epidemic in the country by 2030 could be achieved. Mr Obinna Bright, a beneficiary of the screening, appreciated the agency for bringing the HIV screening and counselling closer to the people. NAN also reports that condoms as well as self testing kits were distributed to members of the public within the market.
