 Senator Biodun Olujimi  Olujimi was installed as the leader of the party in Ekiti State on Saturday by a PDP group being the most senior elected official of the party from the Southwest. She is currently the minority leader in the Senate. “Being the highest ranking elected office holder in Ekiti State and the South-West, I’m not only the leader of PDP in Ekiti, but I am also automatically the party leader in the South-West and everything, including Atiku Presidential Campaign, must be done through me,”Olujimi reportedly said. Reacting to the this, Olayinka said: “Someone appears to be drunk.” While five House of Representatives members of PDP from Ekiti State have expressed their confidence in the leadership of the Gboyega Oguntuase-led state executive of the party (Fayose’s loyal faction), some stakeholders Saturday pledged loyalty to Olujimi, which called for the dissolution of the state party executive. In a communiqué signed at the end of the stakeholders’ meeting held in Ado Ekiti on Saturday, the party said it took the decision to install Olujimi as the leader since she is the most top-ranking elected official in the state and the Southwest. The resolution, signed and read by the Protem Secretary of the PDP Stakeholders and former Assembly member, Hon Bunmi Olugbade, also overruled the SWC on the suspension of former State Secretary of the party, Tope Aluko, saying he remains a bonafide member of the party. However, the House of Representatives members, Kehinde Agboola (Ekiti North I), Thaddeus Aina (Ekiti North II), Ayo Oladimeji (Ekiti Central I), Segun Adekola (Ekiti South I) and Akin Awodumila (Ekiti South II)  expressed their loyalty to the immediate past governor of the state, Ayodele Fayose, saying; “there is no leadership vacuum in the PDP in Ekiti State, those desperate for political leadership should wait for their time.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
