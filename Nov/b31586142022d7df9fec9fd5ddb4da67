Born and raised in a Muslim family, British singer Zayn Malik has revealed that he would not call himself a Muslim and has dropped the religion. The Pillow Talk crooner, revealed this in an interview with British Vogue when he confirmed that he has stopped identifying as Muslim because he no longer “believes any of it.” The former One Direction band member revealed he never talked about his religious beliefs but added, “I’m not professed to be a Muslim”. When asked if he would call himself a Muslim now, he answers thoughtfully, “No, I wouldn’t”. He admitted that although he had a “spiritual belief’ of a god, he did not endorse Islam religious practices such as daily prayer and eating halal meat. He said, “I don’t believe you need to eat a certain meat that’s been prayed over a certain way, I don’t believe you need to read a prayer in a certain language five times a day. I don’t believe any of it. I just believe if you’re a good person everything is going to go right for you.” Malik further added that he appreciates the fact that he went to Mosque and learned about Islam and that there are beautiful parts of the faith but he chooses not to identify with it any more. His declaration has been met with mixed reactions on social media with some of his followers asking that be unfollowed while some even threatening him with vile and abusive words.  Some others are of the opinion that he needs more prayers and guidance at this turbulent time as he’s obviously lost. The news was also met with shock in his home city, Bradford, not because he no longer identifies as a Muslim but because he had the courage to admit it. Some are saying that it’s hardly a surprise given Zayn’s penchant for smoking, drinking and showing off tattoos. Malik is currently dating supermodel, Gigi Hadid.
