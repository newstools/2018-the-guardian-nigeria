• Gunmen attack PDP chieftains in Rivers, kill one
A 19-year-old man, Sunday Owo, was yesterday arrested with fresh human parts at a healing home in Awka, Anambra State. Owo was caught with fresh male genital, human fingers and a bottle filled with the blood of a child. The suspect told newsmen that he hailed from Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State and was directed by one Blessing to procure the human parts and bring to a natural healing home in Awka for money ritual. He confessed that he paid Blessing, who was at large as at press time, the sum of N50,000 for connecting him to the healing home. Owo also told journalists that his victim was a four-year-old boy he killed at the stream in his town and threw the head and other parts into the stream. “She brought me here two days ago and said that madam instructed her to tell me to bring these body parts that I will have money. Her name is blessing, she is also from Ebonyi, but she said we can’t get these parts here so we went back to Ebonyi State where I got it and brought it here, I don’t know where Blessing is now. I paid her N50,000 for linking me up,” he said. But Mrs. Ifeanyichukwu Ilonzo, owner of Centre for Psychic Healing and Administration (CEPHA), Awka, said she had to invite the media and the police on seeing such strange thing. Ilonzo said she and her staff were on ward round after morning prayers when they saw the man with the human parts who said he was looking for her as he has brought the items. She said when the content of the black bag was opened, she instructed her staff not to let him go and invited security agencies and the media to witness what she saw. She said one Blessing Eze had come for healing of fibroid and that she gave her prescription after which she left but had not returned. She added that the Eze in question, whose consultation card she produced, used Ifite-Awka as her address. Ilonzo stated that she suspected frame-up by people who wished to undo her as she has had such attempts in the past, including failed efforts to take her life. She urged the police to identify the owners of the child that was murdered and the Blessing that was working as his accomplice, adding that human life was sacred. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the command, SP Haruna, said the suspect has been arrested, and would come up with the position of the police on the matter later. Meanwhile, a supporter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has been killed in Rivers State as gunmen attack chieftains of the party. The incident, which happened on Wednesday evening at Ipo Community, Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state, left many others with bullet wounds. However, spokesman of the Rivers State police command, DSP Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the incident, said the police are not aware that anyone died in the incident. Omoni noted that the attack was carried out by yet to be identified gunmen, adding that three persons sustained wounds. It was gathered that the PDP chieftains had visited Ipo community for a ward-to-ward Permanent Voters’ Card (PVC) sensitisation when the gunmen struck. It was also learned that the chairman of the Local Government Area, Mr. Samuel Nwanosike, who narrowly escaped assassination, has been taken to a health facility for treatment. A source privy to the incident, who pleaded anonymity, disclosed that the gunmen numbering over 30 and fully armed, invaded the event and shot sporadically. The source also disclosed that killers vandalised many cars, adding that Nwanosike and other chieftains of the party who attended the event only escaped because they drove in a bulletproof vehicle. The Publicity Secretary of PDP in the state, Darlington Orji, accused the leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area of the attack. But, APC in a swift response, denied knowledge of the attack, adding that the attackers are allies of the PDP who feel abandoned by the party. The Publicity Secretary of the party, Chris Finebone said: “We know nothing about what they are saying. We understand their attackers are their former allies who killed and maimed APC members in 2015 and subsequent rerun elections but feel abandoned by the PDP. At least, that’s the information we are hearing. If they truly had credible information about complicity of anyone, why didn’t they approach security agents for arrests and investigation?”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
