A few days after releasing Dabebi, Mr Eazi has released an animated series for the track which features Maleek Berry and King Promise. The visuals are well thought out and looks like Mr Eazi has fully embraced the animated film format. The song was produced by Banku music in-house producer – Guiltybeatz and Killbeatz. Enjoy!
