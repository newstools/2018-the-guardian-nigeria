 [FILE PHOTO] INEC card reader  The Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives’ Committee on Electoral and Political Parties Matters, Alhaji Zakari Angulu, said this on Friday in Birnin Kebbi. Angulu spoke when his committee visited the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state on an oversight function. He said that the visit was to find out the level of INEC’s preparedness ahead of the 2019 general elections. “What we have observed is that INEC is trying in terms of providing Permanent Voter Cards and other election facilities despite the 56 card readers that failed the test out of 3,882,” he said. Angulu explained that the remaining  card readers were okay to be used for the 2019 elections despite the little challenges observed. “The state still has enough time to be fully prepared. “ With what I saw on ground, I am very impressed. “I also want to conclude that they still have room to meet up but that will be left for INEC’s national office to take up and address,” he said. He said that from the committee’s findings, the commission still have sufficient materials that could be used for the 2019 elections in the state. (NAN).
