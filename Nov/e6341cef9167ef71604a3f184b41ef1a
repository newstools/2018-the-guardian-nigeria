Rohr’s programme out next month The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has directed the Super Eagles to commence preparations for the Cameroun 2019 African Nations Cup immmediately. This, it said, should start with the technical crew submitting its programme for the competition. Rising from its executive committee meeting in Asaba on Tuesday, the NFF said the only way Nigeria could actualise its dream of winning next year’s African Nations Cup was by ensuring that the team was well prepared. According to a communique issued after the meeting, the NFF resolved that the Super Eagles’ technical crew, headed by Gernot Rohr, must submit a programme of preparation that would ensure that ‘all available windows for friendly matches before the championship would be fully utilised.”
 
Rohr had earlier said that the Eagles’ programme would be out before the end of the year to give coaches and the players enough room to plan their programmes, including the forthcoming holidays.He discloosed that the game against Seychelles would be part of preparations for the competition, saying he would use the match to test some players who had not been in the Eagles’ set up before.
