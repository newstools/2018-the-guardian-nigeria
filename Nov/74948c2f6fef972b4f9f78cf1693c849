Prosecutors want two influential Catalan civic leaders, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, and former regional parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell jailed for 17 years. In a separate case, they said they were also seeking four to 11 years jail against former regional police leaders including Catalonia’s then police chief Josep Lluis Trapero, whom they also accuse of rebellion. In its statement, the prosecution service said pro-independence leaders planned to use all possible means to achieve secession in October 2017, “including — knowing that the state wouldn’t accept this situation — any violence needed to secure this criminal result.” It said separatist leaders had instigated “big citizen mobilisations” that represented an “intimidating force” and had also used the regional police force, with its 17,000 agents, which followed their orders. The charge of rebellion, which implies “rising up in a violent and public manner,” has caused controversy in Spain where some say the independence bid went ahead without any violence, bar that waged by Spanish police on the day of a banned independence referendum.
