Multi award winner Stormzy will headline the Glastonbury 2019 Festival. Stormzy real name Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo announced the news via a post on Instagram. He headlined this summer’s Wireless Festival and has played Glastonbury festival twice before in the Sonic Tent in 2016 and the Other Stage in 2017. 2017 was an amazing year for the artist as he was the lead artist in the Worthy Farm event’s Other Stage.  Other artists who came to watch his performance include Katy Perry and Chris Martin, the star performed hit after hit from his first album, Gang Signs and Prayer. He also sang a piece from the Grenfell charity single, Bridge Over Troubled Water, which was number one that weekend. Stormzy dedicated the set to his mother, declaring, “Hey, mumzy, look at your boy now,” as he surveyed the massive crowd. Until now, Stormzy has released only one album Gang Signs and Prayer although a second album is in the making. “Very happy to confirm Stormzy as our first headliner for next year,” said Emily Eavis in a post on the Glastonbury website. “He’s one of the most exciting British artists to come along in years and after seeing him play here in 2017 we knew next time he had to come back and headline the Pyramid. See you there Friday night!” Other artists reportedly part of the lineup include Madonna, Paul McCartney and Kylie Minogue – but the line-up is usually verified xlose to the event. Tickets for the festival were snapped and sold out in just 30 minutes after it was made available. The festival will be held on Worthy Farm on 26th-30th June, 2019.
