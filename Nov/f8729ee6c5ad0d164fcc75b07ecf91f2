 Adamawa  Spokesman of the group, Alhaji Abubakar Mubi Seriki, told journalists yesterday in Yola after eight hours of a closed-door meeting of the two political parties’ chieftains that after reviewing the administrative and other credentials of the governorship contestants in the state, Fintri stands out without any competitor. He said that their decision to adopt Fintri from another political party was based on grounds that party politics has failed to bring development in the country and that they decided to support contestants strictly based on their personal merits. “We chieftains of APC and SDP in Adamawa State after carefully observing how political parties are running the country as their private estate at the detriment of the people, we in Adamawa State have decided that 2019 general elections voting will no longer be on party affiliation but strictly on the merits of the individual candidate. PDP has not helped us and APC has worsened the situation so now we decide to put party politics aside and assess contestants on their personal track records,” he stated. Mubi, who is from Bindow’s home-town, Mubi, said that his group put aside politics of sentiments and beamed its searchlight on those that are not seeking political offices for their personal interest, but for the good of the people. He, therefore, urged the people of Adamawa State to avoid party politics and cast their votes in 2019 strictly on the track records of the candidates since party politics has failed woefully to bring development to the state.
