Just when we thought that the feud between Pusha T and Drake was over, Pusha T’s visuals at his show at Camp Flog Gnaw showed up a “F**K DRAKE” graphic. <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-fuck-drake-twitter-3.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="547" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-786607 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-fuck-drake-twitter-3.jpg 728w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-fuck-drake-twitter-3-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-fuck-drake-twitter-3-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-fuck-drake-twitter-3-487x366.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-fuck-drake-twitter-3-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /> This happened while he was performing at Tyler, the Creator’s music fest on Saturday the 09 of November.
The “Adidon” artiste says that he didn’t realise that it was there until the crowd started chanting the words on the graphic. Going with the flow, he continued with his music. But he addressed it after he was done saying that he was not okay with what the tech gut did with the graphic. <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-tweet-twitter-2.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="547" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-786610 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-tweet-twitter-2.jpg 728w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-tweet-twitter-2-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-tweet-twitter-2-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-tweet-twitter-2-487x366.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1111-pusha-t-tweet-twitter-2-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" />
