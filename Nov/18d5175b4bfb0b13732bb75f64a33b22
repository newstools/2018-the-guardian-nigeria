35-year old actress, Tessa Thompson who played the character Bianca in the film, Creed II claims Michael B. Jordan got “really angry” when he was hungry on set. In her interview with Elle, she insists it was understandable that her co-star got irritable during filming because he was pushing himself so hard to stay in shape to play boxer Adonis Creed. She said, “I’m sure a lot of people can relate to this, but he’s really irritable when he hasn’t eaten. He gets really angry. It’s not just sort of like, “Okay, get him a sandwich.” ‘I think it might have also been exacerbated by – when he’s training, there’s certain days where he wouldn’t drink water all day and he was going through very intense training. So he was allowed some irritable days.” Tessa also revealed she was very impressed with the extent that he could “gorge” himself on a variety of “junk cuisine”. She said, “When he’s having a cheat day, he really goes in and it feels like being at a college dorm room, but a really nice one, where the kid has a lot of money, because he just has everything from Chinese food to pizza. ‘Every kind of junk cuisine he’d want. He’s in basketball shorts just gorging himself. But he only had a couple of those days, so he’s allowed.” On her role in the movie, she said “I had some measure of hesitation when I knew that she was going to be pregnant, and some worry that she might end up being the dutiful wife. “I expressed those concerns to Steven Caple Jr, our fantastic director, and those concerns made it into the movie – when she says to him, “I’m not gonna be this barefoot wife making you sandwiches.” That was literally something I expressed to Mike and to Steven and they were like, “Let’s put it in the movie.”
