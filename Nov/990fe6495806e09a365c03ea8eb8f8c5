• Police recover five guns in Lagos uncompleted building, parades suspected killers of policemen in Taraba
• Ogun village head in arrested over alleged N15.5m fraud Suspected ritual killers in the early hours of yesterday beheaded an unidentified man in the Scot area of Oghara community, Ethiope West local government area of Delta State. The ritualists also harvested the vital organs of their victim, leaving his headless body in a pool of blood. Yesterday’s gory sight came exactly two weeks after another victim, a 60-year-old woman, was killed in the same manner, in the same community with vital organs harvested for purposes suspected to be ritual. The development has, however, set the entire community on the edge. When contacted, the Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Muhammed Mustafa, said the police had already commenced investigation into the development. “It is true, someone was killed. Police is on top of the matter. We are working in concert with the vigilance group members and other community security outfits to unravel what really happened and arrest the culprits behind the killing,” Mustafa said. In Lagos, the state police command has recovered five guns hidden in an uncompleted building around Ajah area. According to the spokesman of the command, Chike Oti, operatives of the task force while on routine raid of targeted black spots recovered the guns. “They weapons were recovered while on targeted raids of uncompleted, unoccupied houses and plots of land at Road 1, Block 1, Plot 7, Victory Park Estate, Osapa London, Ilasan, inside an unoccupied shanty. The guns recovered comprise three European-made pump action rifles numbers L926547, R268751 and P987707, one locally-made double barrel rifle and one locally-made single barrel rifle. “Similarly, at Elemoro, 11 armed robbery suspects were arrested at their hideout. Upon searching their den, detectives recovered one berretta pistol and two locally-made pistols,” he said.
 
Meanwhile, the traditional ruler of Ferowa community, in Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State, Chief Muyideen Folorunso, has been arrested by the police on the allegation of N15.5 million fraud.
   
Folorunso’s arrest came on the heels of a petition from a property firm, Jamat Homes and Properties, which approached the Baale for the purchase of 23 acres of land in his domain at an agreed sum of N15.5 million, which the company paid.
 
But to their dismay, months after the payment was made, the suspect started selling the same portion of land to another set of people. Before the company knew what was going on, the Baale has sold 17 acres out of the 23 acres.
 
According to a statement signed by the State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, based on the strength of the petition, the Commissioner of Police, CP Ahmed Iliyasu, directed the officer in charge of public complaints bureau to look into the case and bring the suspect to book.
 
“The Baale was subsequently arrested, and on interrogation, admitted collecting the said amount from the complainant after showing them the land. He stated that it was when he needed some money for his coronation that he was tempted to sell parts of the already sold land.” In another development, the Taraba State police command yesterday paraded suspected killers of three policemen and two vigilance group members in Lau Local Government Area of the state. Also paraded were a gang of rapists, human part dealers, notorious armed bandits and persons involved in offenses ranging from impersonation to defilement of a five-year-old girl. Parading the suspects, the Commissioner of Police, David Akinremi, said the command had in the past weeks embarked on a massive onslaught to rid the state of “gang rape, thuggery, armed robberies, homicide and other heinous crime.
