 [FILE PHOTO] Nigeria Police  Sources said the placenta was allegedly sold by the nurse to the cleric for N20,000 to be used for money rituals. It was gathered that the medical officer in charge of the private hospital who suspected foul play urgently reported the matter to the police, leading to the arrest of the two suspects in different locations on Monday. The incident, which happened at a private medical hospital, located at Oko-Erin area of the metropolis, started when the father of the newborn, one Jimoh Abdulfatah, requested for the placenta of his baby. Sources said the man had taken his wife to the hospital for caesarian operation after unsuccessful efforts of his wife to have a normal delivery at both the Civil Service Clinic and the General Hospital, Ilorin where they had gone for medical attention. Abdulfatah said a nurse at the General Hospital referred him to the hospital. The cleric, whose wife is also pregnant, told the police that the placenta was useless for the purpose he wanted to use it for, adding that the baby was delivered through operation against normal delivery that would have made the placenta useful to him.
