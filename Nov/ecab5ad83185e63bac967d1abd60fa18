Tyreke Evans added 17 points as the Pacers shot 41 percent from the field. Marcus Morris had a team-high 23 points and six rebounds for the Celtics, who shot 43 percent overall in a tightly-contested game in front of a crowd of 17,500 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse arena. Indiana trailed 101-97 after Boston’s Kyrie Irving hit a three-pointer with 37 seconds remaining. Oladipo was fouled by Jaylen Brown with 29 seconds left and made both free throws to cut the Celtic lead to 101-99. With the clock winding down, Oladipo seized a defensive rebound and dribbled up the court before stopping on the right side and nailing a three pointer over top of Boston center Al Horford. On the next Boston possession, Gordon Hayward inbounded and had his pass deflected and stolen by Oladipo, who tossed the ball up to begin the victory celebration. Elsewhere, James Harden scored 25 points in his return to the Houston lineup, and the Rockets defeated the Chicago Bulls 96-88. The NBA’s reigning MVP Harden scored 11 straight points in a two minute span of the third quarter as the Rockets went on a 15-0 run.

He didn’t score until completing a driving layup with 3:55 left in the second quarter. Then he hit back-to-back shots from beyond the arc.

Embiid scored 32 points in a dominating first half which also saw him make eight of nine shots and 15 of 17 free throws.
