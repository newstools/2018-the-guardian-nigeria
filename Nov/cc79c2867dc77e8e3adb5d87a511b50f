 [FILE PHOTO] Suleiman Tony Frangieh is the current leader of the Marada Movement and a Member of Parliament for the Maronite seat of Zgharta-Zawyie, in North Lebanon.  Geagea was accused of leading a militia raid which killed Frangieh’s parents, three-year-old sister and dozens of rival fighters in northern Lebanon in 1978. The two former warlords signed a document pledging “to turn the page on the past and move on to new horizons”, in a televised meeting at the Maronite Christian patriarchate in Bkerke, north of Beirut. Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi hailed the “historic meeting” between Franjieh, who is close to the Syrian regime, and Geagea, a fierce opponent of Damascus.
