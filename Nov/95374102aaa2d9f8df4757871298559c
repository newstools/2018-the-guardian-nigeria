South African based Nigerian artiste, Obafemi Kayode, who is signed to Only For The Family, a company situated in Johannesburg, has released a new single titled, Duro. Speaking about his new project, Obafemi said Duro was inspired by his state of mind at a time. “I was very down and bothered five months ago. Then, the only place I wanted to be was the production studio because it is my comfort zone, and it produced this.” The Afro-pop singer stressed that moving to South Africa was important for him to acquire some other professional skills in cinematography. “I feel I can make an impact from the Diaspora; we all know that the Nigerian entertainment industry is highly competitive. I released my first song in 2006 and there has been a lot of improvement since then.” Also, the English graduate of Obafemi Awolowo stated that he had always enjoyed the support of his parents, saying, he could recall how his mother booked his first studio session where she paid N4, 600. In Nigeria, he admitted that he would like to work with Wizkid, Davido, Olamide, Tiwa Savage, Burna Boy, Wande Coal and Flavour.
