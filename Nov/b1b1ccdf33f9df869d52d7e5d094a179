Trevor Noah’s autobiography book,” Born A Crime”, was basically an ode to his mother, who shaped him into the man that he is today. The film ” Son Of Patricia” is based on his best-selling book- Born A Crime. The comedian, Trevor, will be presenting his second comedy special on Netflix, on the 20th of November called ‘Son of Patricia’. Image credit: Black girls br It was announced in January that Hollywood star Lupita Nyong’o will feature as Trevor’s mother in the screen adaptation of ‘Born a Crime’. The film, “Son of Patricia”, is about immigration, camping racism and lessons Trevor learned from his mother.   Set a reminder in your head! Or… just set one in your phone. Either way, I appreciate the effort you’re giving this right now.
