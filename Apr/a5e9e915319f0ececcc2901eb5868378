  Unidentified gunmen on motorbikes opened fire at a group of Christians outside a church in Quetta, capital of Balochistan province. "Four men on two motorbikes opened indiscriminate fire, killing two people while injuring three others," local police official Abdul Razzaq Cheema told AFP. The attack happened in the Christian-majority Esa Nagri neighbourhood of Quetta, where hundreds gathered to protest the killings. "Around 500" protesters blocked a road by placing the bodies of the two victims in the middle, said local official Javed Anwar Shawani. "We are negotiating with them to make them disperse and bury" the victims, he added.
