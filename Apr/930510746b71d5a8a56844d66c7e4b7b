He will be the first Chinese foreign minister to visit the North since 2007, a lapse that highlights the rough patch that relations between the Cold War-era allies has gone through in recent years. China has backed a series of United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme. But Beijing is likely eager to avoid being marginalised in the wave of diplomacy that has led to last Friday’s historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the South’s President Moon Jae. Kim and Moon agreed to pursue the complete denuclearisation of the peninsula. They also agreed to pursue a peace treaty by the end of the year and hold talks with the United States, and possibly China, to achieve it. The Korean War ceased in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty. China fought on the North’s side. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
