After intercepting a herder with AK-47 riffle and 7.62 ammunition at a farmland in Isigwe Ugbawka in Nkanu East Local Government Area of Enugu State, the Police, yesterday, dismissed claims of tension and possible farmers/herdsmen clash in the state. It would be recalled that a young man was attacked at his residence in Aninri on Tuesday by herdsmen for allegedly preventing them from plucking mangoes from his compound. The herdsmen were said to have inflicted severe machete cuts on him after invading his compound with cows to pluck mangoes, but were resisted.
While the victim is still recuperating at the hospital and the police still on the trail of his attackers, another herdsman was arrested on Friday in Isigwe community with illegal firearms. Speaking on the development, Enugu State Police Command Public Relations Officer, Ebere Amaraizu, assured that the incidents do not portray ‘tension’ in any community or the state in general.He said the police was committed to its responsibilities and would respond to useful information that could prevent crimes in the state. Amaraizu said after the arrest of the suspected herder, the State Commissioner of Police, Dan Mallam Mohammed, had led a team of police officers that included notable indigenes of Isigwe to the farmland for on-the-spot assessment.
