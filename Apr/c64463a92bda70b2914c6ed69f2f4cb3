Girls should be going green with envy by now. After a private listen at Davido’s girlfriend Chioma’s pre-birthday party where he confessed he was in love, he has released a song titled Assurance.  The song is clearly dedicated to her. You can feel the passion he uses to communicate his assurance and love. The song was produced by Speroach Beatz.
