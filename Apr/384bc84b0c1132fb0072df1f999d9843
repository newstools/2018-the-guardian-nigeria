Sponsors of the Premier Skills Initiative, which recently partnered with the British Council to train 33 Nigerian coaches drawn from Lagos and Kano states, have pledged to continue developing grassroots football trainers. Since its inaugural edition in August 2012, the Premier Skills Initiative and British Council have consistently organised training programmes for Nigerian coaches and students from football academies. On March 10 at the Meadow Hall School, Lekki, Lagos, Premiers Skills awarded certificates to the 33 grassroots football coaches who completed the programme.  “This is a very welcome idea,” said Executive Chairman, Lagos State Sports Commission, Dr. Kweku Tandoh.  “One of the things we are focusing on in Lagos State is the development of talents and the development of talents involves, first of all, mass participation by all; it involves people, who will be able to identify talents and also people who will be able to nurture talents.  The Premier Skills is directed at imbibing the right skills in coaches to enable them, not just to identify footballing talents but also to be able to train them for the next level.” The Phase 2 of the training was led by Premier League Coach Educator, Graham Robinson. He was supported by Jack Day from Stoke City Community Trust. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
