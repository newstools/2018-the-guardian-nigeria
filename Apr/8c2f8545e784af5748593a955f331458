 Head of ACCA Nigeria, Tom Isibor  But ACCA’s Global Head, Helen Brand, said there are more that can be accomplished, as the body is capable and willing to collaborate with the Nigerian Army to develop finance professionals. Brand made the observations when the Nigerian Army finance corps team headed by the Chief of Accounts and Budget, Major General Jakko and the Director of Finance and Accounts, Brigadier General Felix Ohunyeye, received ACCA’s management team at the Nigerian Army Headquarters, Abuja. The finance corps team, who received ACCA officials, also included 10 other principal officers.She noted that the courtesy visit was to formally recognise the support given to ACCA students that are members of the force, as well as discuss further areas in efforts to forge a strong partnership. The ACCA team included the Director, ACCA Africa, Jamil Ampomah; Head of ACCA Nigeria, Tom Isibor; Member of National Advisory Committee, ACCA, Taiwo Oyedele; Business Development Manager, Key Accounts, Nigeria, Evelyn Isioye; and Business Development Manager, Northern Region, ACCA Nigeria, Anthony Chukwuma. The ACCA chief expressed the hope that the proposed collaboration is possible given the accounting vision and works already done with employers and an ever-evolving qualification over the years.Key Account Manager, ACCA, Evelyn Isioye, pointed out that there are opportunities for continuous professional development through ACCA Continuous Professional Development (CPD) events for the Nigerian Army under the Approved Employer Programme. “This would ensure that professional accountants from the Nigerian Army Headquarters are invited to attend ACCA CPD events in Abuja,” adding that ACCA stand-alone certifications in specialist areas are relevant for staff capacity building of the Nigerian Army. However, Ohunyeye requested from ACCA, the award of Approved Employer status and partnership with the Nigerian Army School of Finance and Administration.
