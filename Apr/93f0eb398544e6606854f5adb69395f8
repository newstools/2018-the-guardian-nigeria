The January arrests came after sporadic protests erupted in the capital Khartoum and some other towns of Sudan after the price of bread more than doubled. Some activists were later freed but many remain in detention, including top opposition leaders Khaled Omar of Sudanese Congress Party and Mokhtar al-Khatib, head of Sudan Communist Party. SUNA did not say how many prisoners would be set free or identify any of them. The United States and European embassies in Sudan had called for the release of all detainees, with Washington’s mission in Khartoum saying that many were being held in “inhumane conditions”. Sudanese authorities had cracked down on protesters in a bid to prevent a repeat of deadly unrest that followed an earlier round of subsidy cuts in 2013. At that time dozens of people were killed when security forces crushed demonstrations, rights groups say. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
