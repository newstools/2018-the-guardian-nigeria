  Stindl was helped off the pitch in the first half of Borussia Moenchengladbach's 1-1 draw with Schalke on Saturday. An examination has revealed torn ligaments in the left ankle, ruling him out of the finals in Russia, which kick-off on June 14. "To injure yourself so badly at this time is very hard," said Stindl on crutches in Moenchengladbach with his foot in a cast on Sunday. "For one thing, I can't help the (Moenchengladbach) team in an important part of the season, on the other, it is bitter that my World Cup dream is over."
