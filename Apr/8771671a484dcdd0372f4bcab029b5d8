Bayero University Ahead of next year’s general elections, president of the Student Union, Bayero University Kano (BUK), Khalid Sunusi Kani, has raised the alarm over unsolicited patronage and pressure from political actors of various platforms to support their interests. Kani alleged that the leaderships of various student unions were being financially induced to mobile students in support of the political ambitions of the politicians. In a statement he signed and made available to The Guardian in Kano, Kani, a 500-level medical student, said that the attitude of the political actors was threatening the ideology and philosophy of student unionism, saying the move, if left unchecked, was capable of mortgaging the bright future of the country. He noted that regardless of the interest of students, the political class, who he said are currently on rampage, are desperate to impose their will on student’s leadership. According to the statement: “Today, the condition of student unionism is worrisome, the desire of some students for union leadership is not driven by passion and commitment to public service, but rather for fame and to advance personal interests. “Many students’ union leaders nowadays are in the habit of using their privilege to organise unreasonable award ceremonies in the name of ‘solicitation,’ where undeserving persons and politicians are honoured. The criteria for eligibility are usually not based on merit, but on one’s ability to give financial support. “The money realise from such solicitations are usually embezzled among the ranks of the unions.
