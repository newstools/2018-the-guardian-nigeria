 Another pastor killed in Edo
Many persons were reportedly feared dead in a gory clash between some suspected hoodlums and meat sellers at Ajegunle in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State. Although the state police spokesman put the death toll at three, eyewitness claimed 15 persons had died in the fracas. It was gathered that the meat sellers and the hoodlums engaged each other in a free-for-all last week Thursday at Boundary market when some marketers came to sell their products in the community. The hoodlums allocated the space of the meat sellers to those who came to advertise their ware. According to a resident, Mr. Adewumi John, after the advertisers had concluded with their marketing, they gave the hoodlums and the meat sellers money to appreciate them. He said: “The hoodlums were given N10,000 and the meat seller were also given N10,000, but to the surprise of the meat sellers, the hoodlums approached them and demanded that the money be given to them. The meat sellers got furious and told the hoodlums that instead of sharing the money with them, they would rather give the money back to the marketers. Before we knew what was happening, they had started fighting each other.” Another resident who spoke on condition of anonymity said, they thought it was something they could manage on their own and resolve amicably. “I was surprised when the hoodlums and the meat sellers started using dangerous weapons to attack each other. Policemen from our area could not stop them. “On both sides, we learnt eight persons were confirmed dead by their various leaders. Those who were rushed to hospital were also said to have died over excessive loss of blood.” A meat seller who simply gave his name as Alhaji Kamoru said it had been long they witnessed such clash in Ajegunle. “The hoodlums wanted to take us for granted, because it was the same amount they gave us. Presently, about 15 persons have died, while several other people are receiving treatment at different hospitals in the community. We the leaders have been invited to come to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba for investigation into the matter. It was unfortunate we lost six of our members.” Meanwhile, barely four days after suspected herdsmen killed a pastor, Pius Eromosele, in his farm, a Senior Pastor of the Christ Chosen Church of God, Oranmiyan branch, Pastor Benson Iyobosa Isibor, has been killed by yet to be identified gunmen. The late Isibor was killed on Monday evening at about 7:00p.m. while returning from work. He was said to have been shot dead at his residence at Oramiyan Street in Egor local government area. Witnesses said the gunmen lurked around the area until the pastor returned from work when they attacked him. The pastor was said to have been accosted by the gunmen as he was about to enter his house and they inquired if he was Pastor Isibor. It was learnt that Pastor Isibor answered in the affirmative before he was shot three times. Attempts by the gunmen to go away with the pastor’s SUV failed as the car rammed into the perimeter fencing of the building.Eldest daughter of the deceased, Mrs. Rosemary Abu, described her late father as her best friend who could confide in her. She said she was also returning from work when she heard three gunshots without knowing that it was her father that was killed. The Commissioner of Police, Babatunde Kokumo, confirmed the killings and said it was a case murder. He assured that the police would fish out the killers.“The incident happened before 7pm. I was climbing the stairs when I heard the first gunshot. I saw people running for safety. I later heard two other gunshots. I thought it was armed robbers that were in the area. It was my brother that came and told me that my father was on the ground,” the deceased daughter said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
