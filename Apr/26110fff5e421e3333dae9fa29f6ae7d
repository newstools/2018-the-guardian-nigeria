These health workers are the backbone of effective health systems and often times are the only access to healthcare for millions of people. Frontline health workers are the first respondents to deadly diseases, battling to ensure endemics, epidemics or pandemics are properly managed and combated. They educate, treat, heal and sometimes comfort us through difficult times. The World Health Worker Week, a week to celebrate the crucial impact of frontline health workers, and to recognize and appreciate the challenging conditions they face in order to provide care where it’s needed most. The World Health Worker Week holds from April 1 to April 8, 2018 in celebration of the health workers who brave various dangers to keep us healthy. Celebrate the health workers in your community by sharing their story using #WHWWeek hashtag. You can also join in the ‘#HealthWorkersCount because…’ campaign. From providing immunizations and preventing diseases to treating common infections, the frontline Health Workers are heroes deserving of honour.
