Hammed Ali (rtd), of illegal demolition of their property and forceful takeover of same belonging to them despite a court injunction. The fence of the property, which is located at Ocean View Estate, Ogombo, near Abraham Adesanya estate, was said to have been demolished without court order or legal process. Isiaka Ibrahim-Ogundare on behalf of the family hinted that they had approached the Lagos State High Court for an order of interim injunction to stop further trespass or altering of their property. The injunction was granted on April 11 but the plaintiff said it was not adhered to. The family also stated that the office of the Lagos State Task Force Land Grabbers was contacted on the issue and the respondent’s lawyer, Abdulrahman Adegoke, was invited but he did not show up. When The Guardian contacted the defendant’s lawyer, Abdulrahman Adegoke, he said he cannot say anything on the matter.

On March 7 this year, we saw a letter written by L’avocat Legal Practitioners on the instruction of Col. Hammed Ibrahim Ali dated same day informing us to vacate our property and if we refused, in seven days, actions will be taken to recover same without recourse to any person. “Later, some people came to our property to demolish our fence with the aid of some soldiers. These armed men supervised the demolition without any court order or legal process and we were even threatened to be brutalized with firearms. “The defendant when asked to tender ownership documents presented a ‘vague receipt’ on which Hammed Ali was written. The receipt has on it the sum of N100,000 for an amount of an unspecified land and signed by an unknown person. Meanwhile, as at 2006, the land was worth more than N40,000,000 and no one person can sell any land as only principal members and our family head can jointly do so.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
