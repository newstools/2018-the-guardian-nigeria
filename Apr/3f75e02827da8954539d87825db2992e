A medical practitioner, Dr Ademola Foyeke, on Tuesday warned against self-medication in the treatment of malaria and other diseases. Foyeke gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in commemoration of the 2018 World Malaria Day.

The expert also advised that precautionary measures be taken against malaria with the use of treated mosquito nets.
”Prevention is better than cure, so we are still hammering on the use of mosquito nets. “With the use of mosquito nets, the emergence of the disease will even happen, because malaria is claiming many lives than what people are imagining.’’ NAN reports that World Malaria Day is an international observance commemorated every year on April 25 in recognition of global efforts to control malaria. Health experts say globally, 3.3 billion people in 106 countries are at risk of malaria, adding that malaria remains one of the oldest diseases in the world. NAN reports that the Theme for 2018 commemoration is End Malaria for Good. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
