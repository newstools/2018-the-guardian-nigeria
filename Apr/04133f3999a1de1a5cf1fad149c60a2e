PHOTO: SUNDAY ODITA The Lagos State police command yesterday uncovered an illegal brewery where malt drinks and fake stout were produced at Egbe-Afa, Igbobo area of Ikorodu in Lagos. Five of the suspects behind the factory were also arrested by the state police boss, Imohimi Edgal, who took newsmen to the scene. It was discovered that the illegal brewery produced malt drinks, stout and ethanol, which they pump into trucks to bottle at another location. According to the Commissioner of Police, Imohimi, the suspects would be further interrogated to know where the drinks are bottled and sold. Imohimi added that the illegal brewery would be sealed and samples of fake beverages taken to the laboratory for testing. He attributed the discovery of the brewery to the principles of community policing and partnership saying that the people of Lagos now have confidence in the police. The police boss further encouraged residents to know their neighbours as vigilance is the only way to have a crime-free society. “The success story of the police is an evidence that community policing and partnership is working in the state. “This is an illegal distillery where malt, stout and ethanol are being produced in an unhygienic environment thereby feeding poison to the people. You will recall that a fake wine factory was also uncovered at Mushin recently. This is as a result of vigilance and I encourage the people to do more.” The illegal brewery had more than 1,000 drums of brewed malt and up to 100 tanks where the drinks are pumped before supplying tankers. A building where operational items of the suspects were kept was also located close to the illegal brewery. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
