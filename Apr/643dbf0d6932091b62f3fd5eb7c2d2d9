Dwayne Johnson is playing the role of Davis Okoye, a primatologist in the film, Rampage. In the film, he is a loner who becomes close friends with George, a rare gorilla. Unfortunately, a genetic experiment goes awry and makes this ape turn into a raging creature. He meets with geneticist Kate Caldwell (Naomi Harris). They both secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend. Johnson has said that the name is in honour of NFL player Christian ‘Nigerian Nightmare’ Okoye. He said in a tweet: Yes sir, happy you picked up on that. Since my character was adopted by a Nigerian family, I wanted his last name to pay homage to one of my all time fav @NFL football players – the “Nigerian Nightmare” Christian Okoye.
