  In a statement issue in Abuja on Saturday, Yekinni said that the Contact and Mobilisation Committee of the party had met with some political solidarity groups, including the Atiku Solidarity Movement 2019, to seek credible information in that regard. He said AGA had also resolved to set a political standard that would deliver good governance in 2019, observing that the party would be ready to partner with any political groups that shared similar view. “AGA will propose that the presidency be rotational among the six geo-political zones of the country and the governorship will rotate among the congress or senatorial districts in each state. “We need a system of government that will discourage extravagance, corruption, nepotism and do or die politics, among other inappropriate approaches to political developments,’’ he said. Yekinni also commended the Senate for the members’ courage to disband the Buhari Support Group, observing that it was a good development that would boost the credibility of the lawmakers.
