INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu The National Chairman of National Action Congress (NAC), Dr Olapade Agoro, has written the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to de-register both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for allegedly being corrupt. He said the list of alleged looters being bandied around by the Federal Government and the PDP had shown that both parties were inhabited by corrupt politicians. The NAC presidential aspirant, in a letter dated April 4, 2018, and addressed INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, gave the electoral body seven to proscribe the parties. He threatened a legal action if his request was not honoured at the expiration of the ultimatum. Spurring INEC to action, Agoro said he relied on Section 15 sub-section (5) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and it reads: “The state shall abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.” He noted that the alleged confession by former Deputy Senate President, Ibrahim Mantu, that he “rigged election for the PDP” was enough for INEC to proscribe the ruling party and the major opposition party.
