Drake is really fufilling God's plan as he has become the first solo artist having two songs top the Billboard 100 chart for up to 10 weeks. It's Drake's second single to spend 10 weeks at the top, making him the first solo male artist to ever do so. The first was One Dance featuring Nigeria's Wizkid.
Billboard says that "God's Plan" is just the 36th song to top the charts for 10 weeks and only the fifth to ever do 10 weeks consecutively. The other songs with 10 straight weeks at the top are "One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men, "Candle in the Wind" by Elton John, "I'll Be Missing You" by Puff Daddy and Faith Hill an
d"Hello" by Adele. **Reuters
