Fashion stylist and entrepreneur Jane Michael Ekanem turned a year older today To mark her birthday in a very memorable way, the fashionista announced the launch of her new book on her Instagram page. The tell-all book, which took her two years to write, has her talking about her struggle to gain ground with her business, surviving depression and borderline bankruptcy. As Ekanem excitedly announces her new book, she writes: “Today is such a good day to be older, it is a bright beautiful day and I stayed up late watching the clock chime; as excited as a child again to have a birthday.” Photo: Instagram / Leankid “The past year for me has been such a revealing one, it has revealed the shortcomings I took too long to admit, and the strengths I never knew were there. I started my design brand during the recession and despite the pitfalls, it has stood and surpassed expectations, who would have thought? Most business[es] fail in the first year they said, drowning in overhead expenses and struggling to gain ground and a client base; I had all those challenges and more, yet I survived.” “I survived depression and borderline bankruptcy, found a way to smile and show up every time. I stood tall till I got into this new year. Wow, this is the first day of another new year for me, there is so much to come but I am most excited about my book coming out really soon.” Book by Jane Michael Ekanem.

A lot more growth happened in those two years and it is for me more than a compilation of experiences and juicy stories to read, it is a testament that anyone can have the life they believe they deserve regardless of what hand life deals them.” “#Aprilthe29th is a special day and I can’t wait to share what it is about with you all. Happy birthday to me.”
