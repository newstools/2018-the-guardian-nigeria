   It was gathered that the victims, who had been taking refuge at Kange town in Awe Local Council as a result of their earlier displacement in the serial attacks on Tiv communities in the southern part of the state, had gone to carry some food items in their homes when the attackers emerged from a nearby bush and opened fire on them. A resident of the area, Mr. Philip Dodo, who narrowly escaped the attack, told newsmen in Lafia that three of his relations were still missing.Also, President, Tiv Youth Organisation in Nasarawa State, Mr. Peter Ahemba, confirmed the incident in a telephone interview with The Guardian yesterday. The Tiv youth leader, who spoke in an emotion-laden voice, said it was unfortunate that a particular ethnic nationality could be targeted for extermination without hindrance, noting that he had earlier reported the matter to appropriate authorities for necessary action. “For us the indigenous Tiv people of Nasarawa State, we have no any other place to run to, and that is why we continuously count on Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura for a solution on this unfortunate development.“We appreciate the efforts being made by the state government and other stakeholders towards the restoration of our communities but we can only stop crying to the authorities until a solution is finally found,” he said. Ahemba restated his call on the Tiv youths in the state not to resort to taking laws into their hands, as the state government was tirelessly making efforts to end the killings.Police Public Relations Officer of Nasarawa State Command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) John Kennedy, when contacted, said he had not been briefed about the attack.
