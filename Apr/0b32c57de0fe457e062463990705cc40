The Christian religious book, The Bible, says that a good name is better than riches. From the mixed feelings that followed the return of names that once ruled Nigeria in the finance and music world to the takeover of the box office, this week turned out to be full of April Fools’ mischief.

We see him, in his newly released visuals for Heya!, the lead single off his sixth studio album OSO, walk about almost naked– save for a brown leather looking piece covering his groin area. Later on, he is shown playing the grand piano before the camera zooms out to reveal a beautiful aerial shot of Third Mainland bridge and Makoko. Sinzu.

Sinzu had returned from the US prison where he spent two years for credit card fraud and identity theft. Pop star Davido also used his social media platform, Twitter, to welcome him home. Fans of Sinzu hope he will get back on the rap scene as soon as possible. John boyega pacific rim.

Sending shock waves in the North American box office was Pacific Rim with $28 million while Black Panther dropped to second place with $16.7 million. Despite having mixed reviews, the lead role Jake Pentecost (played by John Boyega) is said to be the major highlight of the film. Naira-dollar.

For the two to three hours it lasted, Nigerians could not believe their luck. Despite the exchange rate remaining constant on AbokiFX, some Nigerians still celebrated this rate. While Nigerians planned in grand style what they were going to purchase, it went back to its original rate. We hope they have learnt to take everything they see with a pinch of salt. <img class="size-medium wp-image-594167 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1-1062x590.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="590" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1-1062x590.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1-487x271.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1-974x541.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1-320x178.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1-640x356.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1-600x333.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mavrodi.-Photo-AFP-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /> Founder of the popular Ponzi scheme MMM that shook the foundations of Nigeria, Sergei Mavrodi, passed on this week. Born with a bilateral heart defect, he died of cardiac arrest at the age of 62. After the announcement, many Nigerians said they had found closure, while some claimed it was after his scheme duped Nigerians that a Nigerian sent a heart defect juju to kill him. Nigerians lost a record N18billion after the system crashed. Will MMM outlive its founder? Only time will tell.
