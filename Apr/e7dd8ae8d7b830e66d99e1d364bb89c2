 INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu  They urged the electoral body “not to outsmart the smart card readers,” to ensure that the state witnesses a free, fair and credible election that would be acceptable to all. The traditional rulers stated this at the stakeholders meeting on the continuous voters registration organised by INEC in Ado-Ekiti. Speaking, the Alare of Are-Ekiti, Oba Boluwade Adebiyi, the Attah of Ayede, Oba Mumini Orisagbemi and the Alara of Aramoko, Oba Olu Adeyemi, advised INEC to be transparent in the exercise. But INEC has assured the electorate that the governorship poll would not be monetised like those of Edo, Ondo and Anambra states. It said the commission was aware of how people were being offered N5000 each to cast their votes in those states, saying such would not be allowed in Ekiti through strong synergy with the security agencies. The monarchs, who appealed to politicians to do the right things, warned that Ekiti people were ready to reject any election that does not represent the true reflection of their preference among the governorship candidates. Adebiyi said: “INEC boss, we are aware of smart card readers that will be used for this election. Our appeal is that you do not outsmart the smart card readers, so that we can have a peaceful election. Orisagbemi added: “INEC is like a referee in a football match. We have never heard of a referee trying to score a goal in a match. If INEC, as a referee, wants to score a goal in Ekiti, our people won’t allow that.” Speaking, INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, assured that the commission would not condone votes buying.
