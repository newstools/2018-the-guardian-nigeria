Jay-Z has expressed excitement over the release of Meek Mill. The Roc Nation boss issued a statement on his release. He wrote on behalf of Roc Nation, “We are pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to grant Meek Mill bail and allow him to return home to his loved ones. We are grateful for all the support that Meek has received from his fans and public advocates over the past five months and look forward to working alongside Meek to fight for criminal justice reform.” In a statement released to HipHopDX, “Today, Meek Mill, a son of Philadelphia, is a free man. He was incarcerated unjustly and caught in a probation trap for years by a broken system. Now we can celebrate his release. We thank every individual that has supported and fought alongside Meek every step of the way”. Until yesterday, Meek Mill has spent five months at the Chester State Prison.
