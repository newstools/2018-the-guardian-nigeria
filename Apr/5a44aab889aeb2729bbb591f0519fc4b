On this very day in 1912, the RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on its first voyage from Southampton to New York City. In remembrance of the ship, here are some other great ships that have sailed the oceans of the world. Named in honour of Juan Sebastián de Elcano, the first navigator to complete a journey around the world, she was commissioned in 1927 as a training ship for the Spanish Armada. Since her launch, she has completed 77 training voyages and 10 circumnavigations of the globe. The ship has a permanent crew of 300 members and is 113 meters long with an engine speed of 13 knots and a sailing speed of 17.5 knots. Juan Sebastian Elcano.

She was built in 1982 and is owned by the Gdynia Maritime Academy, who uses her to train officers of merchant and fishing fleets. Since her launch, she has made numerous circumnavigations of the world, most notably to the 200th anniversary of Australia in Sydney in 1988. Her success as a training ship spurred Poland to create four other ships in the subsequent years.
