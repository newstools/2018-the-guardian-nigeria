  Okowa, who disclosed this during flag-off of the first round of the 2018 National Immunisation Plus days at Sapele, attributed the achievement to sustained collaborative effort of stakeholders to eradicate polio scourge. Represented by Health Commissioner, Dr. Mordi Ononye, he commended the State Primary Health Care Development Agency (DSPHCDA) and donor agencies for the synergy and dogged commitment to stamp out the menace. Chairman of DSPHCDA, Dr. (Mrs.) Isioma Okobah called on mothers to take advantage of the exercise to immunise their children from 0 to five years. She said the campaign is targeted at immunising children from 0 to 59 months, with two drops of the oral polio vaccine, regardless of previous immunisation status, adding that the idea was to catch children, who were either not immunised or only partially protected, with a view to boosting their immunity status. “It is absolutely necessary that children get repeated immunisation to fully protect them against polio. We must build a wall of immunity to fully protect the Nigerian child from polio virus, which can only be achieved through multiple dose of oral polio vaccines,” she said.
