   The device, which lasts up to two years, sits just below the cervix and creates a vacuum seal to catch menstrual blood.Its flat shape, which women insert into their vaginas using a figure-of-eight motion, is so thin, its manufacturer INTIMINA claims it cannot be felt by the user or their partner. INTIMINA adds the non-toxic cup does not cause any dryness or irritation, and ensures up to 12 hours of leak-proof reassurance.Holding up to 76ml of blood, the cup is covered in a hexagon pattern that creates friction to ensure it stays in place. Its 100 per cent hypoallergenic material is the same as that of medical implants and has passed regulations set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The cup comes in a discreet carry case and simply requires cleaning between uses. This comes after the launch of period-friendly gym shorts in May last year. The shorts, by underwear brand Thinx, encourage women to get physical while menstruating without having to wear a sanitary towel or tampon. They can allegedly hold up to 10ml of blood, which is the equivalent of two tampons worth.  The shorts have a four-layer structure, with the top fighting bacteria and the lower sheets absorbing moisture, according to Thinxâ€™s website.
