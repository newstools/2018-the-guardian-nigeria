It’s amazing that we have finally stepped out of our parents’ shadows of being engineers, doctors and lawyers, and created our chiliad pathways. The creative scene in Nigeria, particularly in Lagos has grown incessantly, with a wealth of photographers, art directors, graphic designers, creative directors/consultants, you name it! However, In this era of diversification and falsification, social media has its aye and nay. You can spend hours scrolling through your social media timeline and not see any talented creative rather just the ones who are hyped because of the number of followers they have. All these do nothing but bung up your mind. If you are keen on who to follow your timeline can be the spur and help you differentiate the wheat from the weed or the great from the hyped. More often than not the low key creatives with less amount of followers are the ones that are the actual gems of creativity and know how to get the job done. Here are a couple of my personal favourite creatives: Bola Agbaje.

Bola sees himself as a multipotentiality and a creative entrepreneur. while his working on a creative project he is also working on innovating other industries. Bola has worked with some of Nigeria’s biggest names including Wizkid.
He loves to futz around, therefore, throws all his creativity into whatever projects he works on. Onohwosa Nefe.

Nefe specializes in graphic designing and customization he has worked with more people than places and brands. You probably haven’t heard of him because he is one of those low key creatives who are actually busy creating.
Nefe is also the CEO of ”supporting her prime campaign” an NGO which aims at educating girls on menstrual hygiene and also providing sanitary pads to girls who cannot afford it. Niyi Okeowo.

Niyi constantly portrays creativity and uniqueness in all his projects and this continues to leave us in awe. Chisom Njoku.
