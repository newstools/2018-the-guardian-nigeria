  The former governor said this, while responding to a publication attributed to the Kano Zonal Office of the anti-graft agency, signed by its spokesperson, Idris Nadabo, purporting that the commission was about to institute another suit against him. The Kano zonal office of EFCC had, in the statement, disclosed that the commission plans to drag Shema before Justice Babagana Ahmed of Katsina Federal High Court for allegedly laundering the sum of N5.7b meant for the Subsidy Re-Investment and Empowerment Programme (SURE-P). But the Head, Media Team of Shema, Oluwabusola Olawale, said in a statement that the former governor stands by his position that he “is ready to defend himself in a fair and just trial and, therefore, urges the international community to read between the lines to decipher Governor Aminu Bello Masari’s motive and desperation to orchestrate multiple trials.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
