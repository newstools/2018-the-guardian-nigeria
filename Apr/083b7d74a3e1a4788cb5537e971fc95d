The people of Bali Local Government, Taraba State are presently counting their loss, following herdsmen attacks that resulted in the killing of a family of four. The incident, which occurred, yesterday, in Kokotye, an outskirt of Bornon Kuku of the council, was carried out in spite of military presence.
Confirming the attack, the Council Chairman, Danladi Suntai said the attack could be a reprisal of last Wednesday’s killings in nearby Donga Local Government, where the Tiv and Fulani ethnic groups clashed. Wondering why the attacks have remained unabated, he disclosed that a Fulani man was shot in Donga Local Government, but fled and died in Pasa village in Bali. Suntai said he summoned all the Fulani Ardis (Chiefs) and pleaded with them not to allow the spill over of the crisis into the council.“I was surprised, when I was informed that four persons from one family have been killed today,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misal, said the command had not been briefed of the incident, but promised to get back to our correspondent.
