  The Peoples Elephant narrowly made it to the group stage of the competition las week courtesy of an away goal advantage against Bidvest Wits FC of South Africa, on a day three other Nigerian clubs, MFM FC of Lagos, Akwa United and Plateau United of Jos crashed out. In yesterday’s draw in Cairo, Enyimba was pitched in Group C alongside AC Williamsville (Ivory Coast), CARA Brazzaville (Congo) and Djoliba (Mali).
