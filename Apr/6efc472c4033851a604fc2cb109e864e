 An English basketball player stunned his girlfriend by proposing on-court at the Commonwealth Games — but happily, she accepted.  Jamell Anderson lured Georgia Jones, who plays for England’s women’s team, to the centre of the court on Australia’s Gold Coast with the help of team-mates. He then surprised her by getting down on one knee, producing an engagement ring and popping the question. “I had absolutely no idea,” Jones, 28, said. “He told me I was just getting a picture taken.” “I’m just in shock,” a tearful Jones added, struggling to articulate her emotions. “I’m pretty speechless myself and I knew it was happening,” said husband-to-be Anderson, 27. “It’s been on my mind for a while. So now I can just play basketball.” Anderson said his team-mates made for perfect foils to help get Jones onto the court, ostensibly for a celebratory picture after the English men reached the quarter-finals in front of the watching women’s team. “They initiated the plan really well, so that went perfectly,” he said. England’s men beat Cameroon 81-54 to go into the last eight.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
