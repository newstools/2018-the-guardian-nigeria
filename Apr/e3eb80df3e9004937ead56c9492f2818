 Segun Oni  Lawal, who was deputy to Governor Segun Oni, under the PDP platform also dismissed insinuation that he joined the race because of agitation of Muslims that the next governor should come from them. The ex-deputy governor said he decided to quit the PDP to pursue his ambition on other platform because “the party had derailed from all known democratic ethos and foundation laid by its founding fathers.”He also said the sole endorsement of the incumbent Deputy Governor, Prof. Olusola Kolapo by his boss, Fayose as the sole candidate of the PDP for the July election has sealed the ambition of other contenders for the seat. According to him, “I did not at anytime join others to adopt any candidate as the party’s flag bearer for the July election. The action was undemocratic. I was invited to the Government House for a retreat on the election but when I learnt it was a gathering to adopt somebody, I walked out. I believe as a person, I’m qualified to govern Ekiti.“I’m not fighting because of Muslims; it’s not a religious matter. I am out because I have garnered enough experience. We have tried PDP, APC, now let’s try the Labour Party. “If they come with money to give you, collect it from them. It is Nigeria money, it is the money meant for projects that were not executed. So I won’t advise them not to collect but they should follow their conscience.” Lawal, who addressed the press in company with the state chairman of LP, Mr. Banji Omotoso, said he had developed a ‘quartet agenda’, which rest basically on agriculture, wealth creation, education and health.Omotoso, in his remarks, described APC and PDP as failure in the state and urged the people to vote for the Labour Party.
