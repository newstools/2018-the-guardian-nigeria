   Addressing members of the group, the convener, Priscilla Otuya, President of Global Alliance for Mothers of the Nations said the campaign is to speak for the silent majority of women who cannot speak for themselves. Speaking on the theme ‘Respect the Rights of Women and Children to a Safe, Peaceful and Developed Nigeria’, Otuya said women have been made to live under harsh and unbearable conditions and have not complained as well as being subjected to watch their daughters haunted and captured like wild beasts for the slaughter. Otuya said Nigeria belongs to all thus women’s rights to a safe, peaceful and enabling environment must be respected, enough hiding under the cloak of religion to perpetuate evil. She also called on Aisha Buhari to fulfill her campaign promises to women during her campaign for her husband adding that women demand better deal.
Another speaker at the gathering, Apostle Funmilayo Iroh, President of Pottery Heart Initiative for orphans and teenage mothers, urged women to rise up to their responsibilities.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
