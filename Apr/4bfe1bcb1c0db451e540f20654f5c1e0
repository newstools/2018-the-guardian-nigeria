Malta is an archipelago that lies between Italy and Tunisia. It is packed with interesting architecture, brilliant turquoise sea, charming cities and reflects Mediterranean influences from Greece to the Middle East. It also plays host to the capital city of Valletta, which has been named Europe’s Capital of Culture of 2018. Malta is a great place to visit for sea, sun, culture, attractions and all year round events. Here are a few things to do in the soon-to-be top vacation destination: Drink a local Ċisk (pronounced Ch-isk) beer, a refreshing, low-carb golden-coloured lager. Eat fish in a roadside fresh fish restaurant in Marsaxlokk (pronounced marsa-schlock), a traditional fishing village with colourful boats cluttering the bay. Also dine at a traditional Maltese restaurant for an authentic food experience with rich rabbit stews, stuffed bundles of beef slowly braised (Bragioli) and mild Ġbejna cheese. Malta produces some pretty good wines. Book a tour to go wine-tasting in the Meridiana wineries and find your favourite, whether it’s the Isis Chardonnay or their Mequart Cabernet or Merlot blend. Swim in the Blue Lagoon on the island of Comino. The aquamarine-coloured waters are a paradise for water lovers. Soak in a natural pool near Dwejra Bay with its layers of turquoise waters. This UNESCO World Heritage underground burial site dates back to the Saflieni phase (3300-3000 BC) and only allows a handful of visitors within its fascinating subterranean structure, so book a tour in advance. Your trip would not be complete without exploring the UNESCO World Heritage streets of Valletta. The capital city is home to St. John’s Co-Cathedral and Upper Barrakka Gardens, which boasts a panoramic view of Grand Harbour. It is also home to charming narrow streets and trendy restaurants.
