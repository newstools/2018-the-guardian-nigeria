A female worker at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, became a beneficiary of N15 million from popular Nigerian musician Davido. This amount is a gesture to offset her medical bills. The IF and FIA hits maker posted the video on his Instagram Story @davidooffical to share the joy of being appreciated after the surgery was successful. “Aaww I paid for the surgery of a lady that works at the airport and they did this to thank ME! SO CUTE!’’ In the video, some of the airport staff held placards with inscription that reads “OMO BABA OLOWO THANK YOU 15 MILLION NO BE JOKE ooo’’ Though the name of the female colleague was not mentioned but the video clearly showed the appreciation to the 26-year-old for his humanitarian gestures. The singular act of philanthropy was not made public, not until April 18 when the airport threw a stunt at the airport to thank the music star. Davido, who is known for his philanthropic gestures to the needy recently, built a house for Utibet, from Akwa Ibom who was recorded singing Davido’s `IF’ that went viral. He has also given scholarships to indigent students and assisted others with school fees.
