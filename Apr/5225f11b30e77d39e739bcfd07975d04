  This follows the last intervention on Friday, where CBN injected $396.18 million into the Retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS) segment. Tuesday’s intervention came as the dollar exchanged for N361 in the Bureau De Change (BDC) segment of the market, while the official rate remains stable at N305.65 per dollar. Figures released by the Bank yesterday, revealed that the wholesale sector of the market got another injection of $100 million, just as the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and invisibles sectors each received $55 million. Confirming the figures, the Acting Director, Corporate Communications Department at the CBN, Isaac Okorafor, said that Tuesday’s interventions, like the previous intermediations, were in line with the bank’s commitment to sustain the high level of stabiity in the forex market and continually ease access to the currency by those requiring it for genuine activities. Okorafor, while commending the role of every player in the market, said the CBN was ready to inject funds into the market, whenever and wherever necessary, in order to maintain market stability as well as sustain the financial system. He also said the financial regulator was further buoyed by recent gains in the foreign exchange sector, which had seen the country’s reserves soar closer to the $50 billion mark.
