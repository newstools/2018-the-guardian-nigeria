A Pennsylvania jury convicted comedian Bill Cosby yesterday on all three count charges.Â This is seen as a victory in the era of #MeToo. The 80-year-old, in one of the charges, drugged and molested of his then-friend, Andrea Constand, at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. The trial saw a lot of women accuse him of sexual assault dating back to decades. In the trial, five women including Constand testified against him. Meanwhile, Thomas Mesereau, Cosby's Lawyer, has expressed disappointment with the verdict. His lawyers have also said that he will appeal. **Reuters
