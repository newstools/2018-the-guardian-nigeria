A day after releasing one of the most eagerly awaited rap debut albums in recent years, rapper Cardi B made another splash — revealing she is pregnant. The fast-rising 25-year-old star showed off an unambiguous baby bump as she appeared on weekly comedy show “Saturday Night Live,” becoming a top trending item on social media. In a teasing confirmation to persistent pregnancy rumours, Cardi B took the stage twice on “Saturday Night Live,” first concealing her body with a fulsome feather boa as she performed her breakout single “Bodak Yellow.” Cardi B.

Cardi B is engaged to Offset of rap trio Migos, who shortly after his fiancee’s television appearance confirmed the pregnancy on Instagram, writing, “We feel so blessed.” Cardi B, a Bronx native whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, has quickly found stardom with her hard-driving rhymes that unsentimentally tell a story of a rough life that included a stint as a stripper. “Bodak Yellow,” released less than a year ago, made her one of the most-watched names in rap — a genre dominated by men and, often, by machismo. She raked in top prizes including single of the year at last year’s BET Hip-Hop Awards, leading to high anticipation for her debut album — and she is not letting the pregnancy slow her down. The rapper is due to perform next weekend at Coachella, the premier US music festival — whose top headliner Beyonce pushed back her appearance by one year as she gave birth to twins in 2017. The gossip site TMZ earlier reported that Cardi B is due to give birth in early July. ***AFP
