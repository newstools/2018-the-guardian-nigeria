  In a statement signed by its Central Coordinators, Mr. Chineme Onyeke and Mr. Chinedu Eze in response to what they called “sponsored media attacks” against the lawmaker representing Nsukka/Igbo-Eze South in the House of Representatives, Dr. Pat. Asadu, they asked politicians, especially in Nsukka, to campaign on their own programmes. They said:  “We decried a situation where known and unknown faces hide under all sorts of names and pseudo names to attack those they perceive as rivals through hate write ups and smear campaign that has culminated in media attacks on Asadu, who many feel is the frontrunner in the race for the House of Representatives in the Constituency.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
