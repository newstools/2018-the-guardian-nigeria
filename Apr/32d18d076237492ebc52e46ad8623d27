A lot times, the beginning of a relationship seems to flourish and with time it starts to fade. This can happen due to a number of factors like familiarity, distance or routine to name a few. No matter what the reason may be, it should be addressed promptly. Here are some nuggets that could help. As time passes, people tend to sink into a routine and get complacent with their partners. This is because there is a subconscious assurance that this person will always be there. This “assurance” gives birth to a form of laziness that can endanger the relationship if it is not properly dealt with. To tackle this, take a trip down memory lane to the first few months or year of the relationship. Take note of those things you did in the beginning to keep the spark in the relationship and start doing them. As time passes, there is the tendency to assume that your partner knows you well and you do not need to ask for what you want. Most of the disagreements that come from human relationships have their root in expectations and romantic relationships are not any different. Assuming your partner knows your needs all the time leads you into the trap of setting unrealistic expectations. When those expectations are not met, they lead to disappointment which can be harmful to the relationship as a whole. To solve this, be vocals about everything you need from your partner. Asking for what you want is only half the journey. You also need to spend some time to really get to know your partner. It goes beyond what you think you know or what you think he or she wants. If it means you have to go as far as taking notes, it’s not too much to do for a healthy relationship. Always remember that it doesn’t always have to make sense to you, but if it’s important to your partner, it is a priority.
