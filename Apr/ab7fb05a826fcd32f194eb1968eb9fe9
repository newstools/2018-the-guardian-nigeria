   The success of the tourney said much of how highly the Bius are regarded by the golf community. When it was all over with a sumptuous dinner and a dance party, Col. Biu would not dwell on his rich Military career that revolved around past President, General Ibrahim Babangida. Rather, he focused on his times with golf that is almost the same years as his age. For instance, he was Competition Secretary of the revered Kaduna Golf Club as far back as two decades ago. “All my life I have known what service to the people is all about,” Biu said. “Whatever I do, I apply myself 100 per cent. That is me. When I came in as Captain of the Club, I told myself I would turn this great club around. From nowhere the club just died and I told myself I would make it great again. I could be very lucky. I mean a member of the Board of Trustees of the Club and Chairman of the Pinnacle Communications, Sir Lucky Omoluwa just provided us with funds and we turned around things. The same Pinnacle gave us our first Pro-Am tourney after 20 years.” Biu said he decided to sponsor a tournament to mark his birthday and wife’s retirement from Civil Service to remind members of the club that celebrate with kitties in the club. “This is the only way the club can grow from might to might. Let me tell you, a club that doesn’t play tournaments regularly is not functional. We in Kaduna will not be classed as that,” he said.
