 Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje  Ganduje has also formally declared his interest to seek re-election on the platform of the party, saying his decision was based on the need to sustain his developmental agenda for the people of the state. The governor has equally said the people of the state would drag President Muhammadu Buhari to court if he yields to pressures being mounted on him by some Nigerians not to seek a second term in office. Speaking with reporters in Abuja, yesterday, Ganduje, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues were in support of tenure elongation for the party officials, hinted that the decision would surely be reversed during the NEC meeting. He hinted that key decisions bordering on the date and timetable for congresses and national convention of the party would be taken at the meeting, adding: â€œThose who are advocating for tenure elongation are doing so on the premise that when we hold congresses and convention, according to their own perception, there will be a lot of problems and that problem will linger into election period.
