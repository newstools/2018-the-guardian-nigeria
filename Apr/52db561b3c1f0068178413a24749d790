But Jesus used very provocative images in the stories he would tell to incite people to ask hard questions about their own religious assumptions. He regularly provoked. We’re following in the way of Jesus.” The speaker at the programme was Yolanda Norton, a reverend and Assistant Professor of  Old Testament at San Francisco Theological Seminar. She prides herself in coming up with the idea from her class, Beyonce and the Hebrew Bible. The church programme had people sing Beyonce’s I was Here and Survivor. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-616805 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-mass-phamplet.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="751" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-mass-phamplet.jpg 634w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-mass-phamplet-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-mass-phamplet-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-mass-phamplet-487x366.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-mass-phamplet-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Grace Cathedral is the church where activist Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a sermon in 1965 to over 5,000 people in attendance. It should be recalled that in 2017, a university in Denmark introduced the course titled, Beyonce, Gender and Race.
