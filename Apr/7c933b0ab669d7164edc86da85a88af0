 golf  Samuel was the only successful candidate out of the 81 in the January 2018 Qualifying School examination in Jos, Plateau State. Recounting his first experience as professional golfer at the Captain Hosa Birthday Tournament in Benin City, Edo State in February 2018, he said, “it was very bad. I could not swing and putt properly – I was afraid of every move, feeling intimidated among the bigger pros. “But, in my amateur days I was playing more like a professional. I have realised it was a different ball game and very big challenge to be a professional.” Samuel of Lamingo Golf Club, Jos, who is a year two Higher National Diploma (HND) student of Plateau State Polytechnic, Holshe in Jos South Local Government Area, said he was, however, encouraged by co-golfers to rise up to the occasion. “I got huge encouragement from older professionals that I must be courageous instead of feeling intimidated. I also realised that if my performance at the PGAN Qualifying School in January was anything to go by, then I have to prove myself.” Looking forward to a bright future, he said his performance at the Kadinvest Open in Kaduna was encouraging even though he did not win the top prize.
