 Cross River State governor, Senator Ben Ayade  This followed a report that the governor, at a meeting with his commissioners and aides, warned them not to support any other aspirant.The report said they should not have any meeting, interaction or affiliation with any gubernatorial aspirant in the PDP. At the meeting held between April 9 and April 13, the governor reportedly threatened to suspend anyone seen, or caught in romance with any other aspirant.He also allegedly promised to closely monitor them to ensure compliance. But, the group’s spokesperson said: “It is surprising that the governor could single handedly issue an executive order that no other person should contest the position. “Why should the governor give the order to the PDP platform in the state, if he is not culpable of atrocious act against the party?”Oyama said “the situation was not just laughable but funny…I am very surprised that the Governor could think that endorsement means he has been given the gubernatorial ticket of the PDP. The group asked the governor to allow space for other aspirants to test their popularity.It cited Emmanuel Nsa, Emmanuel Ibeshi and other aspirants in the party, who would be foreclosed if the imposition plans succeed. The state PDP Publicity Secretary, Odama Egbung, denied that the governor, or the party had issued such threat.He said: “The party, or the governor cannot give such instructions, because the PDP of today is not the party of yester years where there was impunity. “The party only appealed to stakeholders at the meeting not to abandon the zoning formula to reduce tension.”Egbung added that though the governor would have the offer of first refusal, the party is open to anybody who wants to run for any office.
