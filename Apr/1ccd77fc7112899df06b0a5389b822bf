The Minister also said that for Nigeria to begin production of crude oil in a new oil field, it would cost the country about $10 billion per year for over three years. “Just to get fields online and cap them will require an average of about $10 billion per year in investments over the next three to four years,” he noted. Kachikwu’s revelation on spending $10 billion yearly on developing a new oil field comes on the heels of the clamour that the country has not developed any new oil fields in the past 15 years. Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Dr. Maikanti Baru, said the innovative approach to funding JV operations in response to the challenging economic environment was novel and aligned wholly with the government’s aspiration to increase crude oil and gas production, reserves growth and monetization of the nation’s enormous gas resources.
