The pair, held in the northern Turkish province of Edirne, have been charged with espionage. "They (Greece) ask us to give back the Greek soldiers and we told them 'if you make such a demand, you should first give us FETO soldiers involved in a coup against our state'," Erdogan told the private NTV television in an interview.
