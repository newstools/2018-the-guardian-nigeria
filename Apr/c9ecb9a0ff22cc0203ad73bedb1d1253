Last weekend, Beyonce made history as the first black woman to headline at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, an event which is held annually. As she did the week before, the star delivered a breathtaking performance for the second-weekend set. Also, the show featured a cameo from her husband, Jay-Z, with whom she will be embarking on their joint On the Run II tour in June. The singer also brought out her sister, Solange, Destiny’s Child and J Balvin for Mi Gente. In case you missed it, which, seeing as it wasn’t streamed live like it was last week, many people may not have had the chance to watch it, see it all go down below.    I'm just one of one nothing after me. #Blessed #happy #blackexcellence #God #jamaica #Chicago #love #Gorgeous #Cute #Music #Gyal #beautiful #coachella2018 #coachella #Beychella #video #saturdaynight #jayz #blackgirlexcellence #beyonce A post shared by  Clair Huxtable, Esq.
