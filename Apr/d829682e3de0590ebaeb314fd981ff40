 Gabriel Eziashi  Produced by Mr. Shabz, the new singles are taken from his forthcoming fifth studio album titled Lifted, which is set for release September 23, 2018. Shot on location in Dallas, Texas, the videos were directed by Joel ‘Kachi Benson, who has previously worked with some of the biggest music brands across Africa such as Cobhams Asuquo. The videos capture two polar opposite visual themes, to give audiences a varied viewing experience, while listening to both singles. While Lifted is a gloriously scenic affair, which sees Gabriel Eziashi tapping into the natural outdoors of prayer mountain in Texas, to give praise to God for lifting us up above our circumstances, Yahweh video is a more stripped back studio visual cut, which relies on Gabriel’s performance prowess, and charming personality, to bring the God-revering record further to life.
 
Speaking about the inspiration for the songs, Eziashi said, “These songs come from a personal walk with God. During trials, what we see most as human are the issues at hand, but God on the other hand, sees opportunities and breakthrough. No matter what is happens in life, please understand that there is God, who understands everything – so rest on HIM at all times.” A veteran of over two decades, the prolific songwriter has worked with the international gospel heavyweights including Helen Baylor, Donnie McClurkin, Chevelle Franklin, Muyiwa (Riversongz), and MOBO Award winner, Yolanda Brown; Tye Tribet, Tasha Cobbs, Nathaniel Bassey, and Mike Aremu among others. Eziashi also serves as worship leader at the Festival of Life, where he ministers to over 60,000 Christian revelers every year.
