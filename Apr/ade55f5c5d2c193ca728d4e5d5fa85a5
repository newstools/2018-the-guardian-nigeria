 Cross River State governor Professor Ben Ayade  In the renewed clash, which began on Friday, about five persons were feared killed and several houses destroyed mainly on Inyima side.As at yesterday, a large number of children and women mostly half-naked were seen escaping the community in droves, trekking along the Ugep-Ikom highway to neighbouring Nko village for safety. The scantily clad women, with just wrappers around their waists and children in rag tag shorts and bare bodies looked tired and exhausted, as they trekked down the highway in single file with remnants of their belongings on their heads.    
 
On both sides of the highway, some fierce-looking warriors were seen dangling their Dane guns menacingly in anticipation of any danger.A displaced person, Ofem Ojong said, “our people’ mostly women had to leave the village, because of the attack from Adun. So, you can see we are escorting the women and children to leave. This is very poor and government should intervene.” Armed policemen were seen patrolling the highway and were also positioned by the junction leading to the warring communities to ensure safety of commuters, as well as, check any further spill over of the clash, as was the case on Thursday.
