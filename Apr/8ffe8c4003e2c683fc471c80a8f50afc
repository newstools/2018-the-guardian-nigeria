The announcement comes two days before their second leg tie with Roma in the Champions League, with the club claiming that Buvac stepped back due to personal reasons rather than a bust-up with Klopp. Reports had emerged earlier that Buvac had been absent from tactical meetings and was no longer involved in the team selection. Liverpool confirmed that the well-respected coach remains an employee of the club and his position at the club is not affected by his absence. Buvac has worked alongside Klopp for 17 years with their relationship going back to Klopp’s spells at Mainz 05 and Borussia Dortmund. Klopp brought in Buvac immediately he got to the Anfield to continue their partnership in the dugout. It is believed that Peter Krawiet, who was second coach, will step up into the assistant manager role. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
