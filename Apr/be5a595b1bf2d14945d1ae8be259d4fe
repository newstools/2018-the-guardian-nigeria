Popular relationship blogger and one of our contributors on Guardian Life Elsie Godwin has launched her book titled Oya Start Blogging. The carefully crafted eight-chapter body of work gives insightful wisdom and knowledge to both the young and old about the intricacies of blogging. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-613359 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-1-e1524435173820.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1024" /> In her words, “The aim of writing this book is to get more people blogging beyond the bounds of mere gossip. I want them to embrace blogging as a tool for change.” “There is a great need to pass on this knowledge about the blogosphere especially where there are lots of heresies about blogging from several quarters.” Godwin, who has won several awards globally, was featured in the Top 20 Relationship Blogs across the globe in 2017. Oya Start Blogging is detailed and rich with information that is positioned not only to right the wrong perception created by a few about blogging in the eyes of the right-thinking world, but also to inspire even more creative, conscious and capable minded individuals that have thoughts about becoming bloggers, writers or any other form of literary expertise in Nigeria to pick up their pen and bleed the ink on the papers for the world to embrace, enjoy and be informed. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-613357 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-e1524435244367.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1016" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-e1524435244367.jpg 864w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-e1524435244367-753x598.jpg 753w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-e1524435244367-487x387.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-e1524435244367-302x240.jpg 302w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-e1524435244367-605x480.jpg 605w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image_6483441-e1524435244367-600x476.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Godwin further encourages Nigerians to promote the reading culture among the citizens, stating that there is a need to look into the books and guides to succeed in life.
