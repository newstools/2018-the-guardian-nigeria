Breast ironing, otherwise known as breast flattening, is a cultural practice that cuts across all ethnic groups in Cameroon, Africa. This is especially profound in places like Douala, one of the most populous and largest cities in the country. Men in this area of the country strongly believe that teenage girls as low as 9 years whose breasts are developing are ripe for sex. In reaction, a mother who cares about her daughter and monitors her daughter’s breast growth pounds the breast with hot objects such as a stone, hammer, an umbilical belt or a pestle so that it stops developing. This way, men will find her unattractive and she can pursue her education. True to their plans, pregnancy rate has reduced since 1996. A teenage girl whose breasts are pressed with umbilical belt.
