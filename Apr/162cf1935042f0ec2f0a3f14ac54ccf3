The tripartite committee on the new minimum wage would begin nationwide public hearing in the six geo-political zones of the country from on April 26 and 27 2018. The NLC President, Ayuba Wabba said in Abuja at the weekend that the committee will listen to presentations simultaneously in Abuja, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan, Gombe, Kaduna and Lokoja on the 26th and 27th April 2018. He enjoined all the states within the zones to mobilize to participate in the public hearing. He said each state council and pensions union would be given opportunity to present the joint Labour prepared memorandum, which will be sent to each state by the secretariat. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Labour Congress has bemoaned that the invasion of the hallowed chamber of the Senate by hoodlums and miscreants who carted away the mace and other paraphernalia of authority. Congress insisted that the action is a violation of the sanctity of the Senate and constitutes a threat to our democracy and represents a throwback to those dark old days we are better off without. Congress President said: “It is equally a sad commentary on the quality of representation. We therefore condemn it in its entirety. We similarly invite all who love Nigeria to rise and condemn this crude and sordid act or conduct.” NLC said the Senate, from the days of the Greek and Roman empires from whom the world borrowed the concept of democracy, has always been a sacred arena for the nobility (in carriage, thought or mind), the best and the brightest, the gifted in oratory, a hatchery of the supremacy of ideas delivered in the most sublime and profound language in furtherance of the interest of fatherland. It insisted that as a house packed full of representatives from different parts of the Republic, there are bound to be differences (of opinion, tactics, strategy) and even conflicts but these are expected to be resolved in a dignified manner befitting of men and women of character and learning, It said it is for this reason that there are rules of engagement that every member is made to understand as a precondition to swearing in.
It added: “It is in consideration of this that we consider what has happened as a big anomaly. We do also believe that the National Assembly Security apparatus should be called to question for laxity or compromise. Whereas they have often distinguished themselves by keeping at bay constituents and peaceful protesters from the precincts of the National Assembly, these thugs seem to have walked on a laid red carpet. Could these agencies have been acting alone? What is the degree of their complicity? Whichever way, we condemn this primitive conduct and demand sanctions. Let it never happen again. There are better methods no matter the issues.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
