Anthony WALLACE / AFP  Singapore’s Gao Ning, who suffered shattering defeats in the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games, beat Aruna 11-7 11-8 5-11 3-11 11-9 11-5 in the men’s singles final to collect his second table tennis gold of the day. Gao said “it was one of those matches where sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. It could have gone either way. Today, I felt very calm. “Twice I’ve been the runner up, now the winner but at the Commonwealth Games , I’ve won men’s team and men’s doubles gold medals… I’m happy to win, I just did my best.” Gao and his team mate Yu Mengyu claimed the mixed doubles gold earlier in the day.
