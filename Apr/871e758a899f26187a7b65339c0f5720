He said the current tenure of the administrators, as extended twice so far by the House, was in line with the applicable laws.He cited the Kogi State Local Government (Amendment) Law, 2008, which expired on March 31. Bello requested the House to, in accordance and in line with Part VIII, Section 56(3) of the state Local Government (Amendment) Law, 2008, grant the extension from April 1, to September 30, 2018. “It is therefore incumbent on the state assembly to keep the local government administration within the purview of the law by formally extending the tenure of the 21 Local Government Transition Committees in Kogi State”, he said. He said: “The Kogi State government considers elections the preferred option to fill these positions, but the stark reality is that the administration remains constrained by some ancillary challenges.
