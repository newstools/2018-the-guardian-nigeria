The great thing about curry dishes is that you can add or subtract the veggies you want in your dish. This curry was made using roasted duck legs and store-bought curry paste. The dish is super simple to make and definitely a crowd pleaser. <img class="size-full wp-image-619377 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0026-1-e1525020870460.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" />
