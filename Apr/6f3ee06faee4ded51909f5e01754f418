It is a very strong club, they have an important squad with great players and are a club that want to invest and improve. There are a lot of things that are right.” Chelsea go into Thursday’s clash with Burnley with their top-four hopes hanging by a thread. The Blues trail fourth-placed Tottenham by eight points, even if Spurs have played a game more. Conte said Chelsea would strive to reach the Champions League qualification spots even though the odds are stacked against them. “If we want to be realistic with five games to go, it’s not simple to reduce the gap, but we must have the will to fight, the desire to take this target,” he said. “Why not? We have an important game against Burnley, a really strong team having a fantastic season, and it won’t be easy to get three points.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
