A game based on J.K Rowling’s famed Harry Potter book series was launched yesterday. The game, Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, which was developed by JamCity, a US-based mobile game developer, comes with some special features. Gamers will be allowed to create their characters, choose their house, have potion classes with Professor Snape, see their favourite teachers, go through the transfiguration process with Professor McGonagall, engage in battles with students and go through seven years of training at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, thereby giving them a Hogwarts feel. As gamers progress in the game, it becomes more exciting as they are made to reveal the secrets of an older brother (characters in the game with older brothers who was expelled from the prestigious school). As a tease, Ron Weasley’s older brother, George, will make a special feature. Matt London, a senior narrative designer at Jam City, told Engadget: “You’ll see characters like Professor Dumbledore, Professor Snape, Hagrid, and many more, who’ll appear and interact with the player’s character, during the game. In addition, there are a bunch of new characters as well that we’re introducing.” What makes this game different from the others is Jam City’s ability to merge the bibliography of Harry Potter into one game.  “It’s not a game that you’re going to want to sit down and play for 12 hours straight. That’s not the way it’s designed. We want players to feel like they have Hogwarts in their pocket all the time, and so, it’s a game that I hope players will play for months, if not for years.”, London added. The game is available for iOS and Android users and can be played by everyone.
