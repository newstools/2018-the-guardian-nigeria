 Alibaba / AFP PHOTO / JEWEL SAMAD  The deal is the latest salvo in the intensifying turf battle between tech heavyweights Alibaba and Tencent in the fast-growing Chinese markets for online food ordering and digital payments. Alibaba and its financial arm Ant already owned 43 percent of the app-based Ele.me and said in a statement that it would acquire all remaining shares. It said the takeover puts Ele.me’s value at $9.5 billion. Alibaba did not say how much it was paying for the remaining stake. Ele.me, which means “Are you hungry?”, said it operated in 2,000 Chinese cities and had 260 million users as of mid-2017, employing an army of three million scooter-borne delivery drivers. The statement by Alibaba, an e-commerce leader through its hugely popular Taobao online shopping platform, implied that it would expand Ele.me’s delivery business beyond mere meals.

Users of meal-ordering platforms tripled in two years to 343 million in 2017, the China Internet Network Information Center said. The vast majority use mobile apps. Alibaba has been trying to integrate its online e-commerce services with offline bricks-and-mortar services to ensure growth momentum.
