The Weeknd brought a raw emotional intimacy as he headlined the first night of the Coachella festival, where electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre lit up the California desert sky with lasers and calls to safeguard the environment. Packing 125,000 fashionably — or at least scantily — dressed fans onto the sun-baked site in Indio, Coachella has become the titan of music festivals and a global brand with a who’s who of acts who play back-to-back weekends with identical lineups.

Clasping the microphone before the packed main stage audience, The Weeknd gently cried as he closed his new song “Call Out My Name” to an unadorned guitar, with some fans watching agape as the lights went down. The song — which begins with “We found each other / I helped you out of a broken place” — has raised speculation that the Canadian singer is reflecting on his short-lived romance with pop star Selena Gomez, with whom he was spotted cuddling a year ago when they attended Coachella as fans.
