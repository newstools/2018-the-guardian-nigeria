Specifically, analysts at Investdata Consulting Limited, said: “Even so, value investors continue to position for the short and long-term on the strength of company fundamentals. “However, we would like to reiterate that investors should not panic but go for equities with intrinsic value, especially during this season when dividend payment is ongoing and Q1 results are expected in the market arena. “We advise investors to allow numbers guide their decisions while repositioning in any stock, especially now that stock prices remain volatile amidst improving company, economic and market fundamentals. It is time to combine fundamentals and technical tools to take decision by knowing the support and resistant level to reposition or exit any position.” Further breakdown of last week’s trading showed that a total of 56,260 units of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) valued at N376,387.48 executed in six deals were recorded during the week, compared with the 177,144 units valued at N2.809 million transacted last week in six deals.
