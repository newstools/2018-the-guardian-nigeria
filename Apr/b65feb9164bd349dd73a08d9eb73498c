Alhaji Sidi Ali, Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Sokoto State, said, “Buhari has all it takes to re-contest and the decision is a welcome development. “He is governing well and has the capacity to continue with the good work, and I am sure more good transformations will happen in the country, if he is re-elected.” Malam Kasimu Chiyama, Chairman Dadin Kowa Youth Association in Kwannawa, Sokoto state expressed joy over the announcement.“We will support him fully because he is the only candidate that has been good to Nigerians.” Two Sokoto residents, Hajia Hauwa’u Magode and Abdullahi Maiyogot expressed excitement over President Buhari’s position and prayed Allah to continue to guide him.
