From an early age, Grey found a keen interest in fashion; he was always particular about his outfits, only wearing things that matched his personality and aesthetic. Born Denola Adepetun in Lagos, the style star from Ondo State stepped into the world of fashion at the age of 18. With almost eighty thousand followers on Instagram, fashion, to Grey, is not just playing dress-up; he means business. Denola Grey’s personality is as bright and colourful as his Instagram-filled magazine-worthy pictures. He hosts a show on EbonyLife TV and recently acted alongside RMD and Eku Edewor in the TV series, Castle & Castle. But, beyond the glam and style, there is more to Grey. He talks to Guardian Life about his life, projects and what the future holds.  How did you become a presenter on EbonyLife TV? It all started with creating my website. At the time (2014), there weren’t many male style bloggers, so mine made quite a mark. It led to me writing style tips for men with BellaNaija and subsequently recording style tips on camera for segments on EbonyLife. Soon after, I was asked to guest-host EL Now, which was shot in Calabar at the time, and after a year, I was named one of the main anchors. <img class="size-medium wp-image-595921 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-479x598.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-479x598.jpg 479w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-922x1152.jpg 922w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-446x557.jpg 446w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-892x1114.jpg 892w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-384x480.jpg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383-480x600.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0383.jpg 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /> You’ll be debuting in your first acting role alongside industry heavyweights like RMD. Tell us about how it came about and the experience. That was one of the most surreal rewarding experiences ever. The opportunity came at a time when I was trying to figure out my next move. The audition process was pretty standard. I had been offered acting roles before, but I always turned them down because I didn’t feel like I was an actor. But when Ebony Life Productions invited me for an audition, I decided to go. I got notified about the audition the afternoon before. I memorised five scenes and auditioned with them the following day. I got a callback, where I read with RMD and Mrs Dakore which went fabulously. Two days later, I got an email saying I had landed the role. I’m really thankful. The directors, cast and crew were so warm and supportive. It made for a brilliant start. Is acting something you will be doing more of? Let’s see how I do in Castle & Castle. I will definitely be reprising the role of Benjamin Castle as long as they’ll have me. <img class="size-medium wp-image-595923 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-398x598.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-398x598.jpg 398w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-767x1152.jpg 767w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-371x557.jpg 371w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-742x1114.jpg 742w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21-400x600.jpg 400w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0400_Facetune_27-12-2017-14-14-21.jpg 1332w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /> Does your busy life affect your personal relationships? It gets a little crazy sometimes. For a few months, I really didn’t get to see much of my friends because I worked on two sets and was also managing my other media engagements, so there were a lot of missed hangouts and moments, but my friends understood. As for my love life, that’s not really a priority right now. Single Pringle here.  Who is your style icon? I have so many, but I love the approach Tom Ford has to design: the precision and attention to detail. I want to be more like that. These days, my godfather, Mr Banwo, plays with colour in a fun way and he always looks so cool.
