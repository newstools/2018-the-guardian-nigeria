  Ametuo,  who stated this in a statement issued in Lokoja on Sunday on the botched recall process,  expressed delight that the efforts had come to a premature end through the collective will of the people of Kogi West Senatorial District. “ Melaye , the only senator our party has in Kogi State,  won with 94.66 per cent  leaving the remaining 5.34 per cent to the petitioners. “ The messages are very clear ; that Sen. Melaye is the most popular senator ever produced by Kogi West,” the statement said. According to the chairman, this is a sign of what to expect in the 2019 general elections. “ No amount of financial inducement and coercion will change the will of the people of  Kogi State in future elections,’’  he said.
