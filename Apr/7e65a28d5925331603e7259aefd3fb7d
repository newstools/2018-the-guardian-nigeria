In an evaluation of urban safety for women in 10 countries, Nigeria was ranked second. The report indicated that safety of women and girls in the country is still a challenge. The report maintained that across board, women overwhelmingly still face and are constantly under threat of violence, harassment and intimidation, which keep them marginalised and excluded ActionAid, therefore, advocated the need to ensure that all public services are funded, universal, accessible, affordable, available, and safe for all women and girls. The body pointed out that urban planners are yet to take cognisance of the fact that men and women experience the cities differently, as planned services do not address the different practical and strategic needs of women and men. The report, which also looked at the designing and planning of public transport, stressed the need for increased budget for public transportation, inclusive urban planning and quality urban services within human rights framework.
