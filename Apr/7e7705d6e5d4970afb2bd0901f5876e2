Swedish DJ Avicii is dead, his representative has announced. He died this afternoon after dealing with health issues (acute pancreatitis) for years. This sickness which was partly due to excessive drinking, saw him remove his appendix and gall bladder. His rep released a statement saying,
“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii. He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given”. Despite the worsening condition of his health, he continued to produce beats that got worldwide acclamation but stopped live performances in 2016. He, however, announced he was returning to the studio in 2017. By December, he parted ways with his manager. While he arose to fame with Seek Bromance (2010), he is known for his Levels (2011), Sunshine (2012), True (2013) Wake Me Up (2013) a collaboration with Aloe Blacc. Avicii also has a documentary titled True Stories.
