 Uche Secondus  Obi said although he was not particular about any political party or desires to ride on any party’s back for cheap victory, he sees hope in the reinvented PDP to ventilate his political ideas. Confirming speculations that he is set to contest the vigorous Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema, Oru West federal constituency, the member of Nigeria Guild of Editors told The Guardian: “It is my credentials that will sell my candidature. For once, I want to challenge my people to go for the best among those jostling for the position. I can say without fear of contradiction that I stand head and shoulder over and above my rivals.Therefore, I believe I will ride the crest, irrespective of the fact that Imo has an APC governor.” On his chances of picking the PDP ticket in the highly aggressive constituency, Obi said: “Since PDP is born-again, I expect its leadership to insist on the best and go for quality candidates. I expect there will be no manipulation, no imposition.” He expressed the belief that with a level playing ground, PDP will easily produce quality candidates to change the leadership narrative in the country, adding that representing Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema, Oru West will shape the next House of Representatives.
