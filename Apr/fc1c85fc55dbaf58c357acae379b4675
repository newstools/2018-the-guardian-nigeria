Over 150 children from across the country are expected in Lagos yesterday to take part in the maiden Sunfit-sponsored Ex-Pros National Squash Championship for boys and girls within the age range of 13 and 16. According the organisers of the tournament slated to begin today and end on Saturday at Sunfit Hotel, Amuwo Odofin Lagos, participants would be rewarded with certificate and squash kits. Speaking ahead of the event yesterday, the tournament director, who is also the chairman of Bayelsa Sports Council, Wilson Egberipou said the championship would help to discover young talents spread across the country. He revealed that the organisation has been working round the clock since last year to unearth more talents across the country as part of efforts to reposition the game of squash. “Ex-Pros are delighted to be in the forefront of discovering and nurturing talents in squash at the grassroots level. We decided to call on our sponsors Sunfit to help us create more awareness for squash. The aspiration to groom more talents as a process of revamping the sport in the country is the reason the national championship is organised.
