Ever wanted to do something out of the ordinary but never summed up the courage? Today is Walk On Your Wild Side Day. This is the day dedicated to doing something you have always wanted to do, something out of the blues. The day has become a source of inspiration for decades. The 1956 novel A Walk On The Wild Side written by Nelson Algren and the 1972 song, Walk On The Wild Side, by Lou Reed are inspired by this day.  In the spirit of the song, throw your shoes, wear that clothes, make that contact, try a new sport, have a nice time with friends, ask that person out. If anyone asks you about your unusual act, tell them it is walk on your wild side day.
