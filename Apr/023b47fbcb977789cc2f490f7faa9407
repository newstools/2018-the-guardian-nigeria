Chinedu Okeke and Oriteme Banijo, fondly known as Chin and Teme are proof that the two sides of a coin can work effectively despite the difference in personality. With an understanding of team work, they have managed to effortlessly create what we know today as the “Gidi Culture”: a culture imbibed by the youth-minded people (Gidi tribe) to celebrate and preserve their Nigerian culture. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-594231 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3173-e1522518208561.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" /> Given the five year success of The Gidi Festival, they say people have been beyond amazed that they are not driven by money but by passion.

I say this because we sit down with people and we try to explain the drive behind what we do, and people can't grasp that you can be doing something of this scale and not necessarily print money."
