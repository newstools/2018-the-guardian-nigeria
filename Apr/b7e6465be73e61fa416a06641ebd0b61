Bobby Shmurda (real names Ackquille Jean Pollard) might be out of the Clinton Correctional Facility sooner than expected. Sources told TMZ that the 23-year-old who started serving in 2014, two years before his sentencing, might have his time in jail reduced by two years. Shmurda is serving a 7-year sentence for one count of third-degree conspiracy and one count of weapons possession in September 2016. If he continues to violate prison rules, he might as well just remain there. **Video: Reuters
