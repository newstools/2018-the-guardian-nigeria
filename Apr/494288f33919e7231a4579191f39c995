Sequel to the unconditional release of 22 hoodlums arrested in the act of causing mayhem in Ayetoro Community by an Akure Chief Magistrate Court, residents of the community have urged Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to wade into the matter before it results into anarchy. This was contained in a Save Our Soul (SOS) statement issued by Ayetoro people to Akeredolu yesterday and obtained by newsmen who allegedly accused the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Kola Olawoye of perverting justice. There had been a protracted kingship tussle in Ayetoro, Ilaje LGA of the state since 2015, when one Ajijo Micah was said to have forcefully declared himself as the Ogeleyinbo of the community in contradiction to the culture and tradition of the theocratic community. For the umpteenth time, a gang of notorious hoodlums, numbering 22 unleashed terror on the community on January 11, 2018, causing a lot of bodily harms and wanton destruction of properties. The Guardian gathered then that the alleged rig leader, reportedly snatched the service rifle of a security agent to terrorize the people but he and his gangs were eventually overpowered and arrested in the house of Ajijo. Facing trials in the court presided by Justice Aderemi Adegoroye, the defendants were released by the Magistrate without trial, revealing that she received a letter from the Office of the Attorney General to set them free. The Baba Ijo of Ayetoro Community, Lawrence Lemamu, who is the spokesperson of the theocratic community, lamented that the â€œcriminals did not only use ceased weapons of police to attack the people of Ayetoro but also exchanged fire with the JTF who came to arrest them. Counsel to the community, Sola Oke said he was disappointed in the judicial system, not the court, because the court has a duty to give recourse to the legal advice that came.
