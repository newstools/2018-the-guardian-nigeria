Ahead of her album release today, Janelle Monáe has come out as pansexual. She revealed this during an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, “Being a queer black woman in America … someone who has been in relationships with both men and women — I consider myself to be a free-(love proponent). But then later I read about pansexuality and was like, ‘Oh, these are things that I identify with too.’ I’m open to learning more about who I am”. She is not the only one who has come out as pansexual. Miley Cyrus, in 2016, identified as one. A pansexual is a person who is attracted to all gender. What this means is a pansexual is attracted to transgender, straight, bi, gay and every form of gender identity. To listen to her album Dirty Computer, click here
