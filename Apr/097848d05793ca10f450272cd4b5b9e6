Yesterday at the Tafawa Balewa Cricket Oval, West Africa’s top four teams, including Nigeria, Ghana, The Gambia and Sierra Leone began the quest to qualify for the Australia 2020 T20 World Cup. The teams arrived in Lagos on Thursday for the competition, which will see the top two sides qualifying from the zone to the regional qualifier in 2019. Each of the teams will play six matches in the seven-day qualifying series, which will end on April 21. Speaking on the competition on Friday, ICC Development Manager for Africa, Patricia C. Kambarami, said, “We are delighted that the qualifiers for the ICC World T20 2020 are kicking off in Africa. The Nigerian Cricket Federation (NCF) has worked extremely hard to put the event on, and we wish the best of luck to all competing teams.” The opening game of the competition yesterday saw Nigeria facing Sierra Leone in the morning clash, while Ghana and The Gambia locked horns in the afternoon. Today, The Gambia will meet Nigeria in the first game before Sierra Leone and Ghana clash in the afternoon.
Tomorrow is rest day for all the teams, while The Gambia’s clash with Sierra Leone will open Tuesday’s proceedings, with perennial rivals, Nigeria and Ghana entering the fray immediately after. On Wednesday, The Gambia will entertain Ghana in the morning, with Sierra Leone and Nigeria taking to the wicket thereafter. Thursday is another rest day for all the teams, but action will resume on Friday with Ghana hosting Sierra Leone, while Nigeria and The Gambia will meet in the evening duel. The final matches on Saturday will see Sierra Leone matching wits with The Gambia, while Ghana and Nigeria will round off the competition. According to NCF officials, a lot of developmental programmes, including clinics for children, will hold in between matches of the T20 World Cup qualifiers.
