The Brazilian star suffered the injury, as well as a twisted ankle, in an innocuous looking incident towards the end of Sunday’s 3-0 league victory over bitter rivals Marseille. PSG coach Unai Emery said earlier on Tuesday that “no decision” had been made regarding an operation, denying an earlier report in the Brazilian press that the world’s most expensive player would go under the knife to repair the cracked bone in his right foot. Brazilian newspaper Globo Esporte had claimed a decision had been reached for Neymar to undergo surgery, and that the 26-year-old would be sidelined until May.
