 Russian bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeyeva  The court said that she tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine and admitted the offense, the fourth doping case to hit the Pyeongchang Olympics and second from Russia. Sergeyeva, who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh, “is excluded from the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018”, the court said in a statement. It said the results of the women, competing for the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAS), would be discounted. The ruling came as the International Olympic Committee was debating whether to lift a ban imposed on Russia in December for mass doping. The IOC agreed to allow 168 Russians deemed drug-free to take part as the OAS under a neutral flag. But despite extensive vetting Sergeyeva and another Russian athlete failed tests during the Games.
