Adekunle Gold releases a new song and music video titled Ire. It is a personal song which reflects on his life’s journey with a message that will inspire his fans for a long time to come. Ire is a life lesson packaged in a slow tempo song and accompanied by traditional Yoruba percussion sounds. Adekunle Gold sings in his native Yoruba language as is his usual style. He also sings in English for an uncharacteristic amount of time, alluding to his desire for the song’s important lessons to be understood. <img class="size-medium wp-image-562459 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-487x487.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-974x974.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1-600x600.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ire-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /> According to Adekunle Gold, Ire is a symbolic summary of my life experiences and my journey to becoming Adekunle Gold. Adekunle Gold opens the song singing: “The grass is greener on the other side, that’s what I thought before I took the ride.” He goes on to reveal that “The life I was looking for was already my own,” before telling listeners, “Goodness is calling out to me, it’s telling me to come home.” Watch the video here.
