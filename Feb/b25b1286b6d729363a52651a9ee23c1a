 Muhammadu Buhari  The National Vocational Qualifications Framework (NVQF) is a system for the development, classification and recognition of skills, knowledge and competencies acquired by individuals, irrespective of where and how the training or skill was acquired. The system also gives a clear statement of what the learner must know or be able to do whether the learning took place in a classroom, on the job, or less formally. Speaking at the formal flag-off of the framework in Abuja, the Minister of Education, Prof. Adamu Adamu said government intends to strategically place Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in proper perspective. The minister stressed the need for the nation to produce a workforce that is skilled efficient, adaptable and innovative in order to be competitive. He added that NSQF can offer Nigeria an instrument for promoting the development of new qualifications, making delivery more flexible and widening the range of providers. In his address earlier, the Executive Secretary, National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Dr. Masâ€™udu Kazaure, stressed the need to establish a council that will that will be responsible for the coordination and development of skills and employment policy in the country. He explained that NSQF is aimed at uplifting the TVET system for the development of the country.
