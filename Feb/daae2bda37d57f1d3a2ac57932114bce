Taking a leak isn’t something that we give much thought. When we need to pee, we usually just walk to the bathroom and pee. No one ever thinks of the bladder or the processes involved until there is difficulty in carrying out this simple task. Here are some things that might mean you need to get checked out as soon as possible. Blood urine is a red flag that could mean a number of things. It can be a symptom of kidney stones particularly if the jagged surfaces of the stones scrape the lining of the urinary tract causing inflammation and micro-tears. It can also come as a result of inflammation of the bladder caused by a urinary tract infection. These can easily be treated with antibiotics and a doctor should be seen as soon as possible if there are any signs of blood. Cloudy urine usually doesn’t raise any red flags while standing on its own, but if it has a pungent smell or hurt when you take a leak, there is a possibility of dehydration or an infection in the urinary system. It is important to see a doctor immediately. If urine starts to look a bit darker it’s usually a sign of dehydration. This can easily be solved by increasing water intake considerably. If this does not work, then a doctor should be brought into the picture as soon as possible.  For those who have a small bladder, this might not be a problem for you but if you feel the urge to take a leak more than usual, this might be a cause for concern. It is likely that you have an overactive bladder which is a condition which is more common to women but can affect men occasionally. This might also be a sign of an enlarged prostate especially for men over 60.
