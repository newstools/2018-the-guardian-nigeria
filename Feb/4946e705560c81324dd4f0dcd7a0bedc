 Nigeria LNG  In Africa, significant gas finds in excess of 127 tcf in Mozambique have created the potential for another African super player. Mozambique is expected to become the second-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 2025, as the country steps up production from 10mtpa in 2017 to an envisaged 50mtpa.”
  
Attah noted that the real investment opportunity was last year, when prices were low. “But is not too late; that is why we need to take the decision on train 7 now, so we can stay within the top five space. The future is gas, and NLNG is ready to play. It is time for gas.”
  
He said projections put gas in the top quartile of the most competitive and strategic investments in the global energy market, while a combination of factors will give gas an edge as the preferred energy of the future.
He added that the global LNG trade is projected to nearly triple from about 12 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in 2015, to around 31tcf in 2040.
   
“Electric power sector carbon emissions are projected to be flat through 2050 as a result of favourable market conditions for natural gas and supportive policies for renewables compared with coal. The projections are underpinned by the prospect of the global economy growing at an average rate of 3.4 per cent per year, a population that expands from 7.4 billion today to more than nine billion in 2040, and a process of urbanisation that adds a city the size of shanghai to the world’s urban population every four months.
   
“Global energy consumption will increase in the future but on the other side of the fence, we also see the clamouring for cleaner energy rising and that is where gas comes in. coal will be totally displaced as a source of energy, followed by crude oil. Oil will still be in demand but (particularly as a source of power) will go down by about 50 per cent. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
