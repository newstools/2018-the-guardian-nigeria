He knows that from time to time he must rest,” Zidane told a press conference on Monday, suggesting that the decision was mutual. “He knows this very well and we talk, as always, a great deal.” It will be the second time in three games that the coach has not picked the Portuguese star.

Zidane has called up 19-year-old Oscar from the academy team. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
