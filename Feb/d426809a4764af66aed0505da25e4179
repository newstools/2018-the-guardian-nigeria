Kendrick Lamar has shown an interest in playing a cameo in the sequel of the Black Panther. He said this on the BBC Radio 1. When Claro Amfo asked what role he felt intrigued by and would want to play, he mentioned something similar to the villain, Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. He said: “I really enjoy Killmonger’s character, just off the simple fact, you know, he was a villain but he came with some real [talk],… He was a villain, but he was loved and misunderstood. So if I could, I’d play a Killmonger for sure”. Lamar was behind the soundtrack and album of the Black Panther. The soundtrack also debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. Black Panther, with over $200 million generation in its opening weekend, is in the league of the top five domestic opening weekend of all time.
