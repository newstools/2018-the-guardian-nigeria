CBN As All-share index rises marginally by 0.02%
Panic over the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN’s) directive on dividend payment, among other factors impacted negatively on the stock market, as most banking stocks constituted the losers’ at the end of yesterday’s transactions. Although the All-Share Index rose marginally by 8.59 points, while the market capitalisation increased by N3billion, but five bank stocks from both the tier one and two sub-sects recorded price depreciation. The price depreciation recorded by banks’ stocks may, however, be attributed to some hasty sell-offs by investors especially in the tier two that are most affected by the dividend payment restrictions. Specifically, Diamond Bank lost 0.12 kobo to close at N2.43 per share, while Skye Bank depreciated by 0.03 kobo to close at N1.00 per share. Sterling Bank shed 0.04 kobo to close at N1.88 per share. Fidelity Bank dropped 0.02 kobo to close at N2.98 per share. CBN had released an update on an earlier circular issued October 8, 2014, on internal capital generation and dividend pay-out ratio of Nigerian banks. The major focus of the circular is on the capital reserves of the banks as well as the proportion of non-performing loans (NPLs) in a bid to forestall any threats to customer deposits in the system. Further review of yesterday’s transactions showed that International Breweries topped the gainers’ table, growing by 2.85 kobo to close at N59.85 per share. PZ Industries followed with a gain of 1.15 kobo to close at N24.15 per share. National Salt Company of Nigeria appreciated 1.05 kobo to close at N21.60 per share. Guaranty Trust Bank advanced by 75 kobo to close at N49.35 per share. Redstar increased by 30 kobo to close at N6.30 per share. Consequently, the All-Share Index rose marginally by 8.59 points or 0.02 per cent to close at 42,579.48 compared with 42,570.89 achieved on Friday. Similarly, the market capitalisation, which opened at N15.277trillion rose by N3billion or 0.02 per cent to close at N15.280trillion. Cement Company of Northern Nigeria was the most active stock, trading 134.89 million shares worth N2.25billion.
