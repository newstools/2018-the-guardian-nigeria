In the spirit of Valentine, Nigeria’s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, took to Twitter to announce the engagement of his daughter, Oludamilola, to Hajia Bola Muinat Shagaya’s son, Oluseun Bakare, this morning.  The spokesman for the Vice President, Laolu Akande, said Oluwaseun Bakare, though of Muslim parentage, is not a Muslim and like Osinbajo, is a pastor and a member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. “Oluseun Bakare to whom VP Osinbajo’s first born and daughter Oludamilola would be marrying, is a member of the RCCG Abuja Central Parish and Teenage church pastor there,” Akande tweeted.  However, some members of the public who are surprised by the announcement, have erroneously accused her fiance of being a Muslim and insisted that the church of which he [Osinbajo] is a pastor, enforce strict standards on marriage in accordance with “biblical standards”.    The wedding has been fixed for the 15 to the 17 of March. ** This story has been updated to correct the impression that the fiance (Oluseun) is a Muslim.
