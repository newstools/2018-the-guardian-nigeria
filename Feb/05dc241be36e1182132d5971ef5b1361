 Senator Gbenga Ashafa  In a statement yesterday, Ashafa reiterated his support for Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, adding that he is rather firmly focused on his legislative assignment to the people of his zone.
 
While promising to continue to work for the progress of Nigeria and the party both at the national and state levels, Ashafa recalled his role in rallying the Lagos East General Assembly of APC to ensure that a vote of confidence was passed on Ambode in December under the leadership of Otunba Bushura Alebiosu. According to him, “The APC led administration is doing everything to reposition the country and Lagos is a pace setter in the repositioning project of the APC.
Ashafa therefore urges the people of Lagos East and indeed entire citizens of the state to continue supporting the incumbent administration, saying, “The spate of development in the state is second to none.’’  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
