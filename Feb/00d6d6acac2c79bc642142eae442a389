 Economy  The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, yesterday, affirmed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.83 per cent on average in 2017, representing 2.42 per cent higher than -1.58 per cent average recorded in 2016.
  
The report was the third consecutive month-on-month growth in the Gross Domestic Product of the country, after about five-quarter slump, which put the economy in recession.  She however, warned: “Unless the 2018 budget is approved soon … higher oil prices alone are not going to be sufficient to provide a really strong lift to the GDP numbers.” Also, an Infrastructure Economist at the University of Abuja, Prof. Siyan Peter said inclusive growth, where citizens would  positively feel  the impact of development will continue to elude Nigeria so long as the current administration does not see the need for the setting up of an Economic Team led by Economist. His words: “Inclusive growth can only be achieved if we diversify the economy, where there would be multi -sectoral growth. That way, there would be sustainable growth because you are going to experience employment in all the sectors, hence citizens would now feel the growth. Unfortunately what you have now is the opposite.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
