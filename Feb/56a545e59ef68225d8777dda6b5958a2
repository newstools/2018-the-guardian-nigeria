An adage says the mango does not fall far from the tree. Femi Kuti, the son of Afrobeat pioneer Fela Anikulapo Kuti, reflects this saying. He is one of the few people who has carved a name for himself outside of his fatherâ€™s global success. He notes that his father played a very important unconventional role in his career. "My father just put me out there and said 'find your way' and I really hated him for doing that", he said. Today, he is rather thankful and has joined in the activism struggle and "will keep on fighting for a better Africa".
