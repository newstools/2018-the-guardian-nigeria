Lupita Nyong’o has announced on Twitter that she will be starring in the memoir of Daily Show host, Noah Trevor’s, Born A Crime. She has been slated to act as his mother, a South African woman, in love with a white man at a period when it was unconventional.  His mother played an important role in his life when growing up. Trevor was made to hide away from the public in his first few years with his mother often times using “extreme and often absurd measures”. In 2009, Trevor’s stepfather shot his mother in the head but she survived.
