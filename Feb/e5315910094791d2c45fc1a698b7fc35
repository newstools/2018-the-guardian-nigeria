Another machetes wife, kills self in Delta The Oworonsoki Police Division has arrested one Philip Ononaku, for allegedly killing his former lover, Iyabo Akinpelu, at the Oke-Eri area of Oworonsoki, Lagos State.The suspect was alleged to have overpowered and drowned her in the lagoon on February 11 before her body floated few days later and was found.The 45-year-old suspect had lured the 48-year-old deceased out, tied her legs and hands before pushing her into the lagoon, to prevent her from swimming to safety. According to police sources, the deceased had called the 10-year relationship off after enduring years of battery and domestic violence. After calling it quits, she was said to have found a new lover, a development the suspect was not pleased with.To express his anger, he went to the residence of the two lovers at Oke-Eri Street, Oworonsoki, but was said to have been beaten up by the duo, prompting his involvement of the police. It was gathered Ononaku went to the police to report the assault case and the deceased alongside her lover were arrested and later released a day later. Following their release, the suspect was not pleased and threatened to deal with her for dumping him. Few days after the threat, the deceased disappeared. The family went to report a case of missing person after 24 hours had elapsed. While the police were investigating, a body was found floating on the Oworonsoki end of the lagoon and was later identified by the family and based on the threat he had made earlier, Ononaku was arrested and he has been co-operating with the police. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, confirmed the story, adding that the suspect has been arrested. He said the suspect was arrested by the Oworonsoki Police Division and was transferred to the Homicide section of the State Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba. According to Oti, the job is on the detectives to ascertain the root cause of the murder before the suspect is charged to court. He said, “One Christiana Akinpelu of Oke Eri Oworonshoki came to the station and reported that the former husband of her sister, one Philip Ononaku killed her sister, one Iyabo Akinpelu by pushing her inside river after tying her hands and legs. “The DPO rushed to the scene with his men and arrested the suspect. The body has been deposited in a mortuary and the case was transferred to SCIID, Panti, Yaba.”
Meanwhile, a middle-aged man, Victor Lazarus, has committed suicide after allegedly inflicting severe machete cut on his wife, Evang. Promise in Asaba, Delta State capital. Promise is presently in critical condition at the intensive care unit of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of Delta State command, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the incident to newsmen yesterday. He said the couple was in a pool of blood following the arrival of the police at their home along Ibusa Road, Asaba, adding that they were rushed to Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Asaba, only for the man to give up the ghost afterwards. An eyewitness, who craved anonymity, said the incident occurred on Monday evening when Promise returned from a journey, and her husband descended on her with a sharp cutlass for reasons not yet known.He said: “She returned from a journey that evening, little did she know that the husband had prepared to kill her. As soon as she entered their room, the man started stabbing her from the head. Their son alerted neighbours and then ran to the police who were on patrol to report the case. When the police arrived at the scene, they met the man on the floor. He must have used the same machete to kill himself. His body has been deposited in the mortuary.” Another neighbour said: “This woman has been going through hell in her marriage. There are so many women enduring their marriages they can’t confide in anyone until something terrible happens to them. The woman needs attention, financially and otherwise at this moment for her treatment and recovery.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
