 Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode  Ambode, who spoke yesterday at the commissioning of multiple projects executed by the church in the Gbagada area of Lagos, commended the church for mobilizing millions of its members across the world towards making life more meaningful for members of the community that live around its headquarters. Represented by the Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Olawale Olowu, the governor said Deeper Life has by those projects demonstrated its willingness, not only towards the spiritual upliftment of its members, but also on the quality of life of the people, irrespective of religious inclinations. Projects commissioned included a link bridge on Oduwaiye Street, Gbagada, traffic lights on a number of streets and a 600-capacity multilevel car park. Ambode said the gesture was in line with his government’s drive towards the rebuilding and renewal of Lagos and called on other religious organizations and private sector institutions to emulate the gesture as a means of expediting the revamp of infrastructure in Lagos. The General Superintendent of the church, Pastor William F. Kumuyi, said the church was deeply concerned about the comfort of the people of the communities where it is located, hence its decision to embark on the projects. Kumuyi acknowledged the giant strides the state government under Ambode, saying the governor has been tirelessly working towards renewing the mega city of Lagos. “This has immensely endeared him to the teeming population. What we have done is only a token of support in the drive to ensure there is a collective contribution towards the collective aspiration of the people of this great State for a city of comfort that we all will be proud of.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
