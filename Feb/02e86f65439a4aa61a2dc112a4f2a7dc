 A Somali man stands in the middle of the wreckages of cars as he looks at the scene of a suicide car explosion in front of Doorbin hotel in Mogadishu, on February 24, 2018. At least 38 people were killed and several wounded when two car bombs exploded on February 23, 2018 near the presidential palace and a hotel in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, the city’s main ambulance service said. Jihadist rebels claimed the attack. Mohamed ABDIWAHAB / AFP  The first blast, followed by gunfire, occurred at a security checkpoint close to Villa Somalia, the name for the seat of government, while a second followed soon after at a hotel, according to police. The Shabaab Islamist militant group claimed the attacks in a statement posted online, saying it was targeting the government and security services. The blasts follow weeks of relative calm in Mogadishu. According to officials, the main attack involved the use of a vehicle loaded with explosives attempting to breach a checkpoint leading to the presidential palace, but security forces prevented the assault. “The security forces foiled the intent of the terrorists. They were aiming for key targets but they could not even go closer, there were five of them killed by the security force,” said Abdulahi Ahmed, a security officer. The Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalia’s internationally-backed government. In October it carried out its deadliest-ever bombing, killing over 500 people. In the wake of that attack Somalia’s government declared a fresh offensive against the group and US drone strikes have increased in frequency. While the militant group was pushed out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force it continues to control large parts of the countryside and launches regular attacks on government, military and civilian targets.
