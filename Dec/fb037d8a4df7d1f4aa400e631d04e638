To further add fuel to fire is the fact that the Hemsworth brothers were in attendance, not to mention the Mr and Mrs balloons. Prior to now, a source close to Cyrus had said, “Miley hasn’t announced anything because she is being very secretive so only their friends will know and at the very last minute.” The coming days will determine if the couple are indeed married as we wait for a confirmation of some sort.
