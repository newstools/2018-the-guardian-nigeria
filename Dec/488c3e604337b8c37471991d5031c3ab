Union Bank has reacted to the $2.8 million dollars intercepted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) at the Enugu International Airport on Friday. The Guardian reported that the anti-graft agency in a statement, said its operatives arrested one Ighoh Augustine and Ezekwe Emmanuel, allegedly working for a company, Bankers Warehouse. Tony Orilade, the acting spokesman to the EFCC, said the two were nabbed with consignments of two suitcases, containing $1.4 million each, totalling $2.8 million, at the departure lounge of the airport while about to board an Arik Air evening flight to Lagos. The agency said the suspects confessed that they are have been working with “some notable banks”, for over six years and were in the process of doing same for Union Bank Plc, located at New Market, Onitsha, Anambra State, when they were caught.” However, while reacting to the arrest and it’s affiliation with the suspects Friday evening, Union Bank in a series of tweet said, it was “surprised by the release of a news bulletin prior to the completion of @officialefcc investigation.” Although the bank didn’t expressly claimed the ownership of the money or acknowledged having a transaction with the suspects, it said the action was “legitimate”. The financial institution maintained that “movement of cash across states is routine for all banks” and the Bankers Warehouse mentioned by the suspect is duly “licensed by CBN to provide Cash-in-Transit services.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
