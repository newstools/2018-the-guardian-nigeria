Speaking in Lagos yesterday, President of Lagos All Sail, Maleek Shehu, stated that the tournament would be an avenue for stakeholders in water sports to compete against one another in various sports on water. He noted that plans are in top gear to begin clinic to develop and groom children on water sport from their formative stage in life. “Water Sports has not been popular in the country, and that is why my organisation has decided to organise this event. You should understand that facilities for the water sports are expensive in the country. This is why we are collaborating with boat owners and sailing clubs to take part in the event. The championship will be an avenue for all stakeholders in water sports to also discuss way forward on the sports. Various water sports like sailing, yachting and others will be competed for. At the end, the king and queen of the sea will emerge. Prizes will be given to participants. We are also partnering with those living in villages around the sea in Lagos to be part of the event,” he said. Also speaking, Stephen Ochepo, Marine consultant, Lagos All Sail, noted that the water championship would go along way in promoting tourism in the country. , To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
