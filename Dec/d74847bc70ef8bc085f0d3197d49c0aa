Trey Songz has found himself in the midst of a pregnancy controversy days now that he is reading to settle in a relationship with Steve Harvey’s stepdaughter, Lori Harvey. He may have found himself in a messier situation as porn star, Brittney Jones has posted ultrasound pictures to show that it is more than fans have imagined. Recall that she had explained that the reason he slept with her is because they both wanted to do “sick things” to each other, “something other women were too ashamed to say out loud.” A few hours ago, she posted pictures of an ultrasound photo confirming it is Trey Songz child. To show her seriousness, Jones was online responding to “Trey Fans” who refused to believe that the pictures weren’t something fabricated.   Whew, chile! #BrittneyJones is up and at it early this morning #TreySongz (See previous tea) A post shared by  The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Dec 30, 2018 at 8:23am PST  “Trey fans say I made it with a App but how does a app change the actual photo,” Jones explained on Instagram. “And I spelt my own name wrong. Lmao,” she wrote in another post.   #TSRClearTheAir: #BrittneyJones says that sonogram is real  #TreySongz (See previous post) A post shared by  The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Dec 30, 2018 at 9:37am PST  And if they want more pictures, she is willing to post. Meanwhile, Harvey’s ex-fiance and footballer Memphis Depay has released a new cryptic song, “No Love” which fans believe explains why they broke up.
