Embattled Hollywood actor, Kevin Spacey is ready to make the best of the approaching New Year to make a comeback! The 50-year-old screen star who was slammed with multiple allegations of sexual misconduct over the past several months, has broken his silence with a bizarre video. The “House of Cards” star posted a video today, December 24 in which he is seemingly putting on a performance in the YouTube clip titled, “Let Me Be Frank.” In the cip, he makes use of the southern-style accent of Frank Underwood, his character in “House of Cards”. Judging by the video, he seems to be sending a message that a comeback is in sight. He said, “Despite all the poppycock, the animosity, the headlines, the impeachment without a trial. Despite everything, despite even my own death, I feel surprisingly good. And my confidence grows each day that soon enough, you will know the full truth,” Kevin says. “Wait a minute…now that I think of it…you never actually saw me die, did you? Conclusions can be so deceiving. Miss me?” Watch the video below:  In case you don’t know, Spacey portrayed Frank Underwood in “House of Cards” before the  series resumed without him for the final season.
