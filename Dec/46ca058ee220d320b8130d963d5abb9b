 Telecommunication mast  Meanwhile, the report revealed that growth in the adoption of digital services by government, businesses and consumers is having a positive impact on daily life in Nigeria.
   
According to GSMA, for the majority of Nigerians, mobile broadband is the first and only technology for accessing the Internet, enabling better access to health, education and commercial opportunities, amongst other public services.It noted that smartphone adoption has already risen to over 53 million connections, and 49 per cent of Nigerians are currently connected by mobile technology, compared to less than one per cent who has a fixed-line connection.
   
However, the report concludes that there is still broad scope for Nigeria to increase its mobile penetration. Although more Nigerians are getting access to mobile broadband, the country lags regional peers in 4G adoption. Helping to accelerate adoption would enable more advanced services and create bigger societal impacts.
   
With increased spectrum harmonisation and licensing reform, the country’s mobile penetration is forecast to rise to 55 per cent of the population by 2025, with 70 per cent having 3G connectivity and 17 per cent having access to 4G networks. Currently, only 44 per cent of mobile subscribers in Nigeria are using 3G technology and 4 per cent are using 4G technology, compared to over 18 per cent 4G penetration in South Africa and 16 per cent in Angola.
