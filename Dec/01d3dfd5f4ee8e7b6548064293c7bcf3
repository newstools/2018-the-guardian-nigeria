The crisis rocking Nigerian football over plans by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to stage a Super 8 playoff may be far from over.The Chief Executive Officer of the Bet9ja-sponsored Nigeria National League (NNL), former Ogun State Sports Commissioner, Bukola Olopade, had resigned his position a few days ago over what he described undue interference by the NFF in the running of the NNL, particularly its recent decision to go ahead with the Super 8 play-off, after the NNL had settled for promotion of eight teams to the elite division. It was learnt yesterday that all the eight teams scheduled for the Super 8 playoff in Abia tomorrow have pulled out.The Guardian also learnt yesterday that the sponsor, Bet9ja, has allegedly threatened to withdraw from the NNL League. No NFF official was ready to comment on the issue yesterday.The Guardian recalls that the NNL then came up with a decision not to go for Super 8 play-off, citing force majeure, since the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the NFF had already released its calendar for the 2018/2019 football season.
