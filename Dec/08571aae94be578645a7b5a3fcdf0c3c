Rap star, Future who was recently petitioned by his singer ex, Ciara over their son’s (Future Zahir Wilburn) travel schedule may have just responded. We earlier reported that Ciara petitioned a judge to force him to enter mediation so they can reach a favourable agreement on their son’s travel schedule. According to the court documents filed by Ciara’s lawyers, the 33-year-old singer alleges that Future regularly misses scheduled visits with their son and that he sometimes doesn’t show up until the last minute. In her suit, she also added that whenever the four-year-old goes to be with his father, Future leaves him either with his mother or grandmother while he goes out living his life. Now in an Instagram video which Future posted, he said, “You bothering me. Stop bullying me. Stop nagging me. Leave me alone!” Though he didn’t name Ciara specifically, many of his fans believe he is talking to her. It is noteworthy that Future has four children with four different women and two more on the way with two different women.
