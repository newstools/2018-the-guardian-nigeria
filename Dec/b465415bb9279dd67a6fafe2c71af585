Rapper Safaree Samuels is engaged! He decided to surprise his girlfriend, Erica Mena with an early Christmas present by deciding to drop down on one knee and pop the magical question with a beautiful engagement ring!!! It is learnt that he proposed on Christmas Eve at Mena’s house in Atlanta, where they were surrounded by friends and family. Their engagement is coming after barely a year of dating as the “Love & Hip Hop” stars started dating earlier this year. Speaking to TMZ about the engagement, a rep for Safaree, KD McNair said, “2019 is the year of new beginnings and it’s safe to say our guy Safaree stepped up and put a ring on it.” One of the best parts of the engagement is that Safaree reportedly splurged N63.6 million ($175,000) on the engagement ring, which features 14 carats in platinum and was personally designed by Safaree and Trax NYC. It is further gathered that he surprised his girl with 20,000 rose petals surrounded by 200 candles before popping the question. Safaree pulled out all the stops because 112 was in the house singing “Cupid” and “Crazy Over You” in front of a full, live band in her living room! After Erica said yes, a firework show started outside the house! Watch the proposal below:   Congrats to #Safaree and #EricaMena!!

They were very private about their relationship but as things began to draw to a close, they got a little more public. After the pair called time on their relationship in 2014, things turned sour between the two as they both accused each other of cheating, lying and stealing in a public spat on Twitter.
