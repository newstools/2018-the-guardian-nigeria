She found love again in 2015 in JJC and got secretly married in 2016. However, in 2017, a Lagos-state pastor and founder of Mountain of Blessing and Miracle Church of Christ, Olagorioye Faleyimu, prophesied that she should “pray deeply so as to have children, because without special prayers, she won’t have a child before she dies” to which JJCSkillz responded, “No evil prophecies will come to pass in your (Funke’s) generation.” Congratulations Jenifa Baby!
