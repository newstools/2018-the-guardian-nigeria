Area Fada, Charly Boy (real names: Charles Chukwuemeka Oputa) is set to divorce his wife of 30 years, Diane Oputa today. According to him, he and Diane have ‘seen each other finish’. See finish is a Nigerian concept that is used when a couple have become used to each other and believe that there is nothing left to see or experience. The 67-year-old stated on his Twitter page that he will be getting married tomorrow, the 15th of December. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-812511 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charly-boy.png" alt="" width="1000" height="837" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charly-boy.png 583w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charly-boy-487x408.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charly-boy-287x240.png 287w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/charly-boy-573x480.png 573w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Charly Boy is the second son of late Justice Chukwudifu Oputa, Judge of Supreme Court. Charly Boy joined the Seminary but left after a year. He allegedly contacted his first STD when he was 14 years. Due to his several love affairs, his mother advised him to get married at 19. After two failed marriages, he got married to Diane. It is not known how many children he has. This might as well be a prank. Whatever this is, tomorrow will tell.
