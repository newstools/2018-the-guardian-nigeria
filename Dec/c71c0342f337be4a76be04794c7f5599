What appears as an innocent attempt to move with the fashion of the time has turned into a looming jail term for an Egyptian actress. Rania Youssef an Egyptian actress wore a black,lacy, transparent outfit that exposed most of her legs, to the displeasure of many Egyptians, although some opine she has a right to wear what she wants. According to reports the Egyptian actress who wore a revealing dress at the Cairo Film Festival has been charged of “inciting debauchery.” A judicial source told AFP that she could serve five years if she is found guilty. Ms Youssef apologised and said she would not have worn the dress if she had known it will cause such contention. Rania Youssef.

One of the lawyers Mr Sabri told AFP that her appearance “did not meet societal values, traditions and morals and therefore undermined the reputation of the festival and the reputation of Egyptian women in particular.” The Egyptian Actors’ Syndicate also criticised the “appearance of some of the guests”, which it said “undermined the festival and the union”. The actress via a social media post said she had”probably miscalculated” in choosing to wear the dress. “It was the first time that I wore it and I did not realise it would spark so much anger,” she said. “I reaffirm my commitment to the values upon which we were raised in Egyptian society,” she added.
