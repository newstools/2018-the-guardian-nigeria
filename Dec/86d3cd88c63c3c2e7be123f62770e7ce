 [FILES] President NIMN, Mr. Tony Agenmonmen.  He said the state of the institute is getting better and brighter. “We are not there yet, but we can clearly see the light of a brand new era, an era where marketing professionals can be truly proud of their institute, an era in which the institute is well respected, and eras in which the institute will play its rightful role in national discuss and policy,” he stated. Agenmonmen, who assumed office about two years ago, said the institute had to battle several challenges related to debt, workforce, wages and also membership that had virtually lost interest in its affairs, but noted that with the commitment of council members the institute’s fortunes had been turned around. He said one of the notable milestones in the past two years was the formal proclamation of the enabling Act by Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, which represents the formal coming into force of all the provisions of the enabling Act of 2003, adding that the institute also recently commissioned a new well-equipped and furnished office complex in highbrow area of Ikeja GRA. “We are almost done with the re-structuring of the institute into a leaner, fitter and technology-driven organisation and gradually winning back the confidence of members as well as that of corporate Nigeria. He also promised to drive professionalism among members, while calling on marketing professionals to join in building the institute. Agenmonmen commended the new fellows for the professional heights they have attained in marketing, adding, “It is the institute’s expectations that you will continue to play your role in the development and growth of marketing in Nigeria.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
