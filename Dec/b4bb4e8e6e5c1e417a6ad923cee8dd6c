Nigeria Police Force on Wednesday denied that Inspector General of Police Ibrahim Idris has ordered the arrest and killing of Senator Dino Melaye “There is no such order from the Inspector General of Police or any plan by the Force to arrest Senator Dino Melaye and inject him to death, police spokesman Jimoh Moshood said in a statement. “If the Senator knows he had committed any crime or he is aware of his involvement in any crime, he should come out and confess and face the legal consequences instead of whipping up sentiments to distract the public.” Melaye, who has a running battle with Kogi State governor Yahya Bello, has accused the Nigerian police on several occasions of working with the governor to harm him. He doubled down on that claim on Tuesday. “There is a plan by the IG to arrest me today and inject me to death. Men deployed already. CP Kogi and others removed. Nigerians watch out,” Dino Melaye tweeted on Tuesday. However, the Police said Melaye’s claims were false and described it as hate speech aimed at putting the force into disrepute before members of the public. The Police spokesman said the allegations of Dino Melaye is laughable as “there was no such order from the Inspector General of Police or any plan by the Force to arrest Senator Dino Melaye and inject him to death.” He, however, urged the Senator to come out and confess and face the legal consequences if he has committed any offences “instead of whipping up sentiments to distract the public.” “Senator Dino Melaye is hereby called upon to know that his statement constitute a criminal defamatory offence, hate speech and hateful conduct.” “He should however as a law-maker be law-abiding and desist from un-senatorial and lawless utterances that cannot be substantiated with facts,” Moshood said.
