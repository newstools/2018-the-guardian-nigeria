This, indeed, is the best of times for the fast rising artiste, Victor Adere, popularly known as Victor Ad. He is surely enjoying the best of the moment at his record label, Etins Record, amidst speculations that he has left the outfit. Only recently, the label purchased a Mercedes Benz 4matic Sedan car for him. This car has since been delivered to the furnished apartment provided by the label. This shows that the label is indeed out to make the artiste comfortable and happy, which will make him focus on his career and further develop himself. Since Ad released his viral hit song, Wetin We Gain, in 2018, and it became an instant hit among youths, who quickly adopted it as a kind of anthem, Nigerian youths have accepted the artiste wholeheartedly, mostly because of the messages the song passed across. It was like a shout-out song to all hustlers, and it became more of a street anthem with everyone screaming, “Oluwa bless me, I want chop this money.” It was the hit single that got him signed by the Ghana base label in 2018. It was gathered that recently the artiste has been under pressure from some ‘selfish’ individuals to abandon the label that took him from grassroots to stardom, “but he is not ready to take a step that will affect his career,” said a source close to the artiste. The Guardian gathered the artiste “is wise enough not to make such an ungrateful decision as that could mean doomsday for his budding career.” According to the source, “barely six months after he signed up with the label, he has released two videos. One for his hit song, wetin we gain and another for his new song titled, No idea. These songs are well promoted globally.” It was also learnt that the artiste is working tirelessly on some new songs and collaboration that will send his fans into frenzy in the coming year and broaden his fan base. The Delta-born, but Lagos brought up artiste’s love for music was inspired by his encounter with musical legends such as, Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Lucky Dube and Sunny Ade. He was greatly influenced by their music. He, however, started showing his passion for the genre at the age of six. Ad began a professional music career in 2014 after he graduated from the Federal Polytechnic Auchi, Edo State; it was then he started pursuing a career in music seriously. His first released song was titled, Jowo, and it was released in the year 2014. However, he came to limelight after being featured by Nigerian rapper, Erigga, in another hit single, Motivation, an inspirational song. He sang the chorus of the song and did a perfect job. Aside these songs, Victor Adere has also released a few amazing singles, such as, Thanks, Bigger You, Body Go Tell You, Loving You and No Idea.
