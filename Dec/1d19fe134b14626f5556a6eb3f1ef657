A Director at the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Mrs. Tayo Oreweme has harped on the importance of discipline for athletes to achieve their dreams of becoming world champions in their chosen fields. Oreweme, who represented the Minister for Youth and Sports Development at the 8th edition of Tony International Gymnastics (TIG) championship in Abuja over the weekend, said it was only hardwork and discipline that can take athletes to the podium. While praising the efforts of the founder of TIG Gymnast is Championship, Tony Asuqo, for identifying the talents from the grassroots, Oreweme said there will be no elite athletes if there is no strong foundation. “Any sport that does not have a good bedrock will not excel,” she said. “If you do not have a good grassroots development and club like this, you cannot have a good elites athletes. If clubs like TIG is in 36 states of the federations, 36 wonders will happen to our sports.” Oreweme called on other coaches and talent hunters to emulate the good works of the TIG boss in order to take sports in Nigeria to greater height. Also commenting on this year’s championship, the founder of the club, Asuqo said he was impressed with the turn out of young gymnasts this time, as he disclosed that over 300 gymnasts from Lagos, Abuja and the neigbouring states, as well as children of diplomats attended this year’s event. Asuquo said his focus for next year is to organise more clinics for the athletes and coaches so as to improve the standard of the gymnastics in the country. “This year’s competition is a huge success as we are now looking forward to the All Africa Games and other competitions on our calendar. “We are now craving to go out and bring back medals from game. We will also strive to be good ambassador of the country anytime we are out of our shore,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
