Data Centre Dynamics (DCD), the global Data Centre Industry media and publishing company with an operation in over 42 different countries has announced Mr. Sunday Opadijo, Chief Engineer, Rack Centre, Lagos, Nigeria as the winner of its 2018 Data Centre Manager of the Year. In choosing the Data Centre Manager of the Year, the august panel of judges looked for exceptional success stories, triumph in an adverse situation, quick thinking, prevention of a catastrophic failure, ingenuity in solving tricky problems and traits of leadership that created a stronger team or a better workplace. The DCD noted Mr Opadijo, a Data Centre expert with a wide range of experience in the IT and Telecommunication Industries, was a manager “working in the harshest of environmental conditions including high humidity and temperamental power grid but has maintained a 100 percent uptime and dealt with situations that would have sent shivers down most data centre manager’s spines.” The annual global DCD Awards celebrates industry’s best data centre projects and most talented people and this year’s awardees, DCD says, “like previous ones were selected by an independent panel of data centre experts from hundreds of entries, arriving from across the world-” our expert team of independent judges pored over nearly two hundred entries from across the world, selecting the shortlist across fifteen categories, before the winners are announced.” Mr Opadijo, said it was an honour to be chosen as the Data Centre Manager of the Year by such a prestigious organisation -“ this award validates my dedication and commitment  to maintaining high quality standards  and  helping my organisation to maintain a strategic, competitive edge by providing strong positive leadership and driving excellent performance in the teams, projects, and services, in order to maximize the business value to the organization.” Dr Ayotunde Coker, MD/CEO of Rack Centre expressed his delight at Sunday Opadijo’s award, noting this as a testament to the great world class talent we can cultivate in West Africa.
