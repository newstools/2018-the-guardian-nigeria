Fast rising music act, Harrison Joseph Bright Chijioke, better known as Joharry has dropped his latest offering, Day One, an infectious tune. Tyce produced the song, which features Shyboi, an artiste from the stable of Swag Boss Records. It was mixed and mastered by Zeeno Foster. Born and raised in Lagos, the Swag Boss recording act hails from Abia State. With eyes set on becoming the new school prince of African sound, Joharry’s style of music delivery is unique. He notes that his passion for music started at age 10 while in his church choir, where he learnt and mastered the rudiments of playing the piano and guitar. His biggest influence comes from 2Face Idibia and Afrobeat legend Fela Anukulapo Kuti, who he described as his role models in the industry. While Joharry is still a work in progress, ‘Day One’ is one infectious tune that will stand the test of time just like the singer cum songwriter is a breath of fresh air on the African music scene. He is determined to compete neck to neck with established acts on both the Nigerian music landscape and Africa at large.
