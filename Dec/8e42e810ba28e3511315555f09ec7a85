Despite acclaimed efforts by the current government to improve the economy in the past three and half years, the unemployment rate has dramatically risen.With a breakdown that shows 115.4 million unemployed Nigerians out of an estimated 190million as released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), experts and other stakeholders are projecting that the unemployment rate may likely hit 30 per cent as higher institutions continue to turn out graduates.   
 
Experts submitted that the rate may be exacerbated simply because government has no ready-made jobs for the unemployed youths.They explained how the private sector could help stem the tide, only if government could give them the enabling policies to thrive, as weak capacity to attract foreign investments and challenging local business environment have been attributed as major reasons limiting the private sector capacity to create jobs.
 
The NBS last week released that Nigeria’s unemployment rate increased from 18.8 per cent in the third quarter (Q3) of 2017 to 23.1 per cent in Q3 2018.With 20.9 million people unemployed at the end third quarter, the statistics bureau stated the economically active or working age population (15 – 64 years) increased from 111.1 million in Q3 2017 to 115.5million in Q3 2018.  Director of Entrepreneurship Centre, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Dr. Adebisi Abayomi said government and other concerned stakeholders need to think backward by ensuring the fact that the youths are encouraged to be self-sufficient and create businesses on their own even while in school.He told The Guardian how UNILAG has trained its students on the need to drive one to self-sufficiency and creating things by themselves to prepare them for life after graduation.
