 Healthcare  According to him, since government alone cannot achieve affordable and accessible health care to the people, it is only wise to partner private sector with a view to using their amenities provided.
 
He stressed that more emphasis should be laid on primary health care as done in advanced countries, up to the secondary and to the tertiary level because the ordinary man in the street cannot easily assess health delivery in other levels. Silva said the event was an effort to start a very rudimentary system of primary health care by empowering the traditional healers and birth attendants, who are often the first on ground. He said: “As a private NGO, we thought we are in a position to initiate something like this to assist government in doing its work in the hope that they will take this in and continue on that level, work with other private sectors to achieve what they supposed to achieve”.
 
According to him, the idea is to take care of the majority of people so that by empowering them we are impacting knowledge so that they can do their jobs even better and the discrimination against them for doing quack medicine will fall off within time.
