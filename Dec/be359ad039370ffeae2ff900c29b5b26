Nigerian entertainer, Reminisce who plays the role of Makanaki in the blockbuster film, “King of Boys” has disclosed in a chat with HipTv how he rejected the role for almost eight months. According to him, he was unsure of his ability to pull through his role in King Of Boys when he saw veteran actress, Sola Sobowale who plays the role of Eniola Salami in her element on set. The ace rapper dished that he arrived the film set to shoot his first two scenes on his birthday and after seeing the lead Sola Sobowale, he felt he couldn’t go ahead with his role. He said, “So, yeah, I took up the challenge and my first day on set, I saw aunty Sola Sobowale in her full element. It was my birthday and Olamide was waiting for me at a night club but I had to shoot some scenes. So, I saw her in her full element and I told Kemi I can’t do this. She asked why I said look at this woman na, I can’t do this. This woman is in another world, I don’t want to mess up, I can’t do this. But Kemi convinced me and said she believed I can do it and I went back home and returned to give my best like you all saw in the movie”. Reminisce further revealed that it took eight months before Kemi Adetiba was able to convince him to feature in the movie, ‘King Of Boys. He said, “I wasn’t so sure I could do it because I had so much going on at that time but Kemi Adetiba was able to convince me and this took about eight months. Though there were a lot of other names flying around but she said no, that she wanted Reminisce to do this.” Watch the video below:  It is noteworthy that Reminisce made his acting debut in the film “King of Boys”.
