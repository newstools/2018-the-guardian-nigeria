IEDPU is an umbrella body for the indigenes of Ilorin, the Kwara State capital city. But the event turned sour when Abdulrasak was about to make his donation to the IEDPU as suspected thugs apparently sponsored to the occasion embarked on unprintable slogans forcing an abrupt end of the programme. The ensued chaotic atmosphere forced the highly revered Emir of Ilorin out of the venue as he was guided out to safety by some security agents at the event. “The development at the IEDPU programme where some louts and street urchins shouting ‘Sai Bukky’ disrupted a community event is disappointing, embarrassing and antithetical to good moral and ethics for which Ilorin community is known,” Abdulrazaq said in a statement. “Apart from reminding everyone of the desperation for which the evil status quo in Kwara is known, the sad event clearly points at the extent to which the parasitic gangs will go in the coming months to continue to keep Kwara and its people down. “The disruption of the event just when the Kwara APC governorship candidate Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq was about to give his speech exposed the shenanigans of the urchins and their paymasters whose uninspiring radio programme earlier in the day has drawn the scorn and condemnation of every Kwaran home and abroad. The disruption was probably a damage control for their insulting radio programme. “The intention was to damage the good image of the APC candidate and slow down the tsunami that is already consuming their unproductive political fiefdom in Kwara. But they clearly failed in their evil plot as their thugs — similar to what they did in Offa where their ankara wears betrayed their allegiance — were too crude to conceal the fact that they were on an errand to attack AbdulRazaq and make it look like the fine gentleman was going about with thugs. But the media team of Nigeria’s senate president Bukola Saraki, who was also at the event, said the disruption was caused by Abdulrahman, whom it accused of turning the event into a political rally. It, however, did not deny that the APC candidate was shouted down persons loyal to Saraki. “The event which took place at the Emir of Ilorin’s forecourt had been going on smoothly until Abdulrahman and one Yahaya Seriki attempted to turn the event to a campaign rally. “Abdulrahman was, however, shouted down by thousands of admirers of the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, who countered him by sporadic shouting of “Sai leader, Sai Bukki, Atunwa 1”. “All attempt by the organisers to restore normalcy and continued the programme proved abortive.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
