Nigeria Professional Football League club, Katsina United has been ridiculed for the location and facilities available for their medicals with newly-signed players. One of the photographs that made the rounds on social media had the Super Eagles goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa shirtless laying on a bed in what seemed like a small hotel room. The dimly-lit and poor quality picture was posted by the social media handle of Katsina United much to the chagrin of commentators.

The player had the sensory devices hooked to his chest but incredulously wasn’t provided with a bed with sheets. Unknown player during medicals for Katsina United.
