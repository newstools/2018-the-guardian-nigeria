The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday served President Muhammdu Buhari quit notice at its presidential campaign rally in Ilorin, Kwara State. Director General of the Atiku/Obi Campaign Organisation and President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki said the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government has failed in all facets of governance. He asked Nigerians to vote out Buhari and the APC in next year’s general elections, adding that the APC had failed to deliver on all its 2015 campaign promises. According to Saraki: “APC promised Nigeria a lot of things. They promised us security, at a time we had security problem only in the North East, but now it has extended to North Central, and even the North West. APC has failed because security has worsened. “People are dying of hunger because the economy has gone terribly bad. They have also failed in fighting corruption. The hunger is serious in the country today. Nigeria is today the world’s poverty capital. We need a president that will fix the economy, create jobs and unite Nigerians.” Atiku lamented that the nation has gone worse under the APC, hence the need to provide an alternative administration that can make things work in the nation again. “Today in terms of economy, Nigeria is the poorest in the world. These are facts from international organisations. The security situation has become terribly bad,” he said. Atiku alleged plans by the APC to buy permanent voters cards from people as a way of perpetrating electoral fraud, but urged Nigerians to guide against the plan so as not to mortgage their future and that of their children. PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, while appreciating the large turnout of the people for the rally noted that Nigerians have been suffering since APC took over power in 2015. Meanwhile, National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, has vowed that Atiku would be humiliated in the 2019 poll. Oshiomhole spoke yesterday when he received women leaders of the APC from across the local government councils from his home state, Edo. He also said Atiku’s main backer, former President Olusegun Obasanjo would be disappointed over the outcome of the poll. He lambasted Secondus, for calling for the resignation of the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris and Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu.
