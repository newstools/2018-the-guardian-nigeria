In our own case, we signed, not because it was a ceremony but because we believed in it.“We want Nigerians to send a strong message to President Buhari that he must exhibit exemplary leadership quality that will ensure our election does not end up taking the country and the people down. “And the way to do that is to listen to the court of public opinion, and that is that the country would want to have the best electoral act possible, and the way to ensure we have it is for the President to sign the electoral amendment bill 2018 into law. “We should, therefore, come together to agree on the rules of the game, as far as the use of military is concerned.
