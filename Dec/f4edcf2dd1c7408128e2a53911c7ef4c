 [FILE PHOTO] Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa.<br />  Deputy Governor, Real Admiral John Jonah (rtd) stated this when members of the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), on a data- reviewing mission to the state, paid a courtesy call on the government. He also called for the devolution to powers to the states as too much power and responsibilities are vested in the federal government. While calling for more revenue for the development of the Niger Delta areas, he said the swampy nature of the land in Bayelsa makes it difficult to build and thatâ€™s why they keep demanding for more. Speaking on the devastating flood that rendered many people homeless and farms destroyed in the state, Jonah said the state was yet to get a kobo from NEMA. Federal Commissioner in charge of the delegation, Aliyu Mohammed said they were in the state to verify the data provided by the state for the review of the sharing formula.
