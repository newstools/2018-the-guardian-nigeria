The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has confirmed the death of former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Sabundu Badeh. In a statement signed late Tuesday in Abuja by Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola said Badeh died from gunshot wounds he sustained when his vehicle was attacked. The statement reads:” ‪It is with a heavy heart that I regretfully announce the unfortunate demise of former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Sabundu Badeh, who died today, 18 Dec 18, from gunshot wounds sustained when his vehicle was attacked while returning from his farm along Abuja-Keffi Road.‬ “On behalf officers, airmen and airwomen of the Nigerian Air Force, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, commiserates with the family of the late former Chief of Defence Staff over this irreparable loss. We pray that the Almighty God grants his soul eternal rest.” Badeh has been facing trial since 2016 at the Federal High Court, Abuja, for alleged N3.97billion fraud brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission  (EFCC). Ever since he was granted bail to the tune of N2billion on March 10, Badeh had been regular in court to face his trial. He was expected to open his defence on the next adjourned dates of January 16 and 17,  following the dismissal of his application for ‘no case submission’.
