The Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA) has come out to defend the removal of the billboards and posters of the Lagos State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Jimi Agbaje. Agbaje, on Saturday, had petitioned the Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, over vandalism of his campaign posters and boards. At a Security/Stakeholders Meeting with INEC and political parties summoned by the Lagos Police Command, on Wednesday, General Manager of LASAA, Mobolaji Sanusi, explained that the PDP candidate did not seek the permission of the agency. Sanusi said unlike his counterpart in the All Progressives Congress (APC), the PDP candidate did not get authorization before mounting the billboards and pasting the poster, especially on the Lagos Island. “There are rules and regulations guiding the pasting of bills and posters in Lagos State which must be strictly adhered to,” he said. Sanusi stated that the agency on weekly basis, clean up to remove any poster or billboards mounted illegally across the State. However, the police boss advised that all political candidates should always engage the agency before mounting billboards and also take the advantage agency’s discounts. “Lagos State is politically matured. The removal of the billboards and poster could not have been an intentional act and that is why I have invited the LASAA MD to be here today in order to clear the air on the issue,” he added. Some other parties present, however, accused LASAA of being biased, claiming that the agency favours APC more than other parties in the state.
