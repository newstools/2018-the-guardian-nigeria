 [FILE] Benue  President of TYO, Timothy Hembaor, in a statement made available to The Guardian, yesterday, said reciting Akume’s statement by the National Secretary of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Saleh Alhassan, was a way of saying, “herdsmen will launch more attacks of Benue people.” The group quoted Meyitti Allah’s secretary, Salleh thus: “Senator Akume has told the whole world that it was Governor Samuel Ortom that recruited those responsible for the killings in the Benue Valley. “Again, the Miyetti Allah spokesman made this mockery of Akume’s statement in the presence of ambassadors of several European countries and diplomats from other parts of the world. “We are deeply worried by this development because Akume has given Miyetti Allah group a reason to sponsor more gory attacks on innocent Benue communities. Now, the terrorists have an alibi to hide under an armed militia to spill more blood in Benue State, no thanks to the political and ill-motivated comments of Senator Akume,” the group added.
