Presidential Candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP), Kingsley Moghalu, has urged Nigerians to reject the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the upcoming elections. Moghalu accused the two parties of “tribalism and ethnic irredentism,” noting that the twin evils have caused much damage to nation’s unity.He said the situation has left the country broken when it should have become a real nation. In a statement to The Guardian yesterday, Moghalu promised that if elected, he would unify and heal Nigeria of extreme tribalism by establishing a philosophical foundation of the Nigerian state. The plan, he added, will unite the people around a common ambition and a national identity, instead of tribal ones.Moghalu flayed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s reported statement at the palace of the Alaafin of Oyo that ethnic Yoruba should vote for President Buhari in 2019. Osinbajo had said voting for Buhari would give the Yoruba the chance to produce the President of Nigeria in 2023. He described the call as a sad and disappointing appeal to tribalism in leadership selection in the 21st century.He added: “That this statement comes from an educated personage as Prof. Osinbajo, shows us why we must turn our backs collectively on the recycled old politicians as represented by the APC and PDP. “Also, senior officials of the APC-led Federal Government have been peddling ethnic identity politics to win bloc votes in the 2019 elections. Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, had reportedly assured the southeast geo-political zone that they essentially will be “granted” the presidency of Nigeria in 2023, if they re-elect President Buhari in 2019. Also, the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Raji Fashola, argued that the presidency should return to the southwest in 2023.“This duplicitous and primordial politics of the APC-led federal government, alongside vague promises peddled by the PDP of an “Igbo presidency” in 2023 is a proof, assuming any was needed, that politicians from any part of our country. “Those who believe that anyone will “grant” them their constitutional entitlement to leadership aspiration in Nigeria and determine when their “turn” for national political leadership has arrived, are living in a fool’s paradise,” he said. Moghalu warned that the political inferiority complex could consign parts of Nigeria to second-class political citizenship and hamper the realisation of an inclusive democracy in our country. The former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) charged Nigerians to vote for candidates, based on merit and not the backward approach of “zoning” that recycles mediocrity.He said: “Our old, recycled politicians, with their incompetence and their tired, divisive politics, have failed. They have given us poverty instead of prosperity, unemployment instead of jobs, and a comatose economy instead of the wealth of nations in a globalised world. “We must now reject them at the ballot box in 2019 and vote for a modern leadership that can take citizens out of poverty and the country into the 21st century.
 He said the YPP has a plan, rather than a mere promise to do just that, and a plan to execute the plan,” the statement said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
