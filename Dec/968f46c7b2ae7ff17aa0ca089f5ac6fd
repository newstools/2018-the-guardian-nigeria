Less than a week after Prada was accused of pulling off a Black Face at a window display, Forever 21 has joined in the drama. Only this time, it takes a different ad style. Forever 21 used a white model to represent the Black Panther merch, which was one of the biggest films of the year. The merch which appears on “Forever 21s Wakanda Fair Isle Sweater” with a blond looking model striking poses with the sweater merch having a Black Panther mask and Wakanda Forever printed on it. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-815893 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Forever-21-Black-Panther.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1190" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Forever-21-Black-Panther.jpg 612w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Forever-21-Black-Panther-503x598.jpg 503w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Forever-21-Black-Panther-468x557.jpg 468w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Forever-21-Black-Panther-202x240.jpg 202w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Forever-21-Black-Panther-404x480.jpg 404w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Forever-21-Black-Panther-504x600.jpg 504w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> After backlash from the Black Community, Forever 21 quickly responded. According to TMZ, “Forever 21 takes feedback on our products and marketing extremely seriously. We celebrate all superheroes with many different models of various ethnicities and apologize if the photo in question was offensive in any way,” their rep said. While some are contemplating on using their products, others think the backlash is unnecessary. I’m still wearing #Forever21 . Ya pressed over not a got damn thing. Has everyone forgotten #Wakanda and it’s people are fictional created by a white mans vision ?
