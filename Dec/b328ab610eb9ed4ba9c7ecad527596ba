The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, said he did not attend the signing of a peace pact for 2019 presidential elections in Abuja because he “did not receive any formal invitation.” “Following media enquiries as to the absence of HE @atiku from the signing of the Peace Pact, I wish to state that the PDP presidential candidate did not receive invitation to the event,” Atiku’s spokesman, Paul Ibe tweeted on Tuesday. The 2019 peace pact, convened by a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, was to commit the candidates and the political parties to a peaceful poll. It was gathered that the peace pact would also involve all the chairmen of the political parties that fielded candidates for the presidential election. However, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari attended the event alongside other candidates to sign the peace agreement, which was drafted by the National Peace Committee. This is not the first time such event will be held: a  similar pact was signed by presidential candidates in 2015.  Details soon.
