A 300-level student of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, Aisha Omolola Abdulganiyu, has committed suicide, blaming her parents for the decision she took to kill herself. This was confirmed by the university on its official twitter handle @Tweet_abuzaria, which stated: “Aisha Omolola, a 300 Level student in ABU took her own life today.  She reportedly took poison “Sniper” earlier today in her apartment at Samaru, which immediately took her life.” The female student took her life in the early hours of Wednesday after hanging out with her friends. She reportedly ingested a harmful substance after she wrote a goodbye note. In the note, she bade farewell to her friends and loved ones, stating that her life had been made a living hell. The young lady noted that her parents blame her for their mistakes. Abdulganiyu, who took sniper, left a note for her friends with important details including her phone unlocking code and bank debit card pin number. She also blamed her parents in the note, saying her death will bring them comfort, including her brother who at a time had the responsibility of raising her. She added in the note that she should be buried immediately. Abdulganiyu stresses in her death note a rough relationship with her mother, who accuses her of witchcraft. Being allegedly without maternal love and issues relating to discovering one’s essence, the student opted for suicide, apologizing for the pain her death will cause friends. According to reports, the late Abdulganiyu had just spent time with her friends and fellow students at the university before making the final move to take her own life.Despite a challenging situation with her mum, the deceased still has good thoughts about her even in death. “Just like I said, if I am no more please hold my family together, especially my mom,” she wrote.
