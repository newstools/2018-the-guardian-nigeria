The FA had announced on Thursday that the Spaniard had been charged over the incident — which took place at full-time of the Gunners’ 1-1 draw on the south coast — although Emery himself had initially hoped his apologising to the home supporter would have been enough to see him escape punishment. “I hope so, yes,” the former Paris Saint-Germain boss had said when asked whether his apology should be the end of the matter. “But I have to respect the decision because it is a circumstance of my action but not another intention from me with the supporter. I say to them my apology.” Emery has however escaped a touchline ban and will be free to take charge when Fulham visit the Emirates on New Year’s Day.
