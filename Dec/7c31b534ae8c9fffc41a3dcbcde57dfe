Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered a tomb which they say is the final resting place of a high priest undiscovered for 4400 years. The secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Mostafa Waziri described the discovery as “one of a kind in the last decades”. The tomb was found in the Saqqara pyramid complex near Cairo and has colourful hieroglyphs and statues of pharaohs. Decorative scenes show the owner, a royal priest named Wahtye, with his mother, wife and other relatives. Archaeologists will start excavating the tomb on 16 December and expect more discoveries to follow – including the owner’s sarcophagus. Egyptian Tomb.
