 [File] Senator Dino Melaye (APC – Kogi West) PHOTO: INSTAGRAM/DINO MELAYE  In a statement signed by his Special Adviser (Media and Publicity), Yusuph Olaniyonu, Saraki noted that a situation where the police invaded the home of a Nigerian lawmaker, interfered with the supply of electricity and water to the house, beat up and cuffed his domestic staff and disturbed the peace of his neighbours by claiming he allegedly committed an offence in July was unacceptable. He said: “the timing and desperate attempt to arrest the Senator is suspicious, as the man had raised alarm a few days before the invasion that there was an attempt by the police to get hold of him and inflict injury on his person, an allegation that was denied by the police. “The general belief now is that the Police action against Senator Melaye was aimed at keeping him out of circulation, so that he would not participate in the general elections in February. The manner of invasion was highly suspicious. This same man has been charged with sundry and needless allegations and he has attended various court sessions. He is also a candidate in the coming elections and therefore has no reason to run away from the country. “If there was an offence allegedly committed in July and the police waited till now, we do not see the urgency in the need to arrest him about six weeks to the election in which he is a candidate.
