Rapper Meek Mill was on “The Breakfast Club” earlier today and according to him, there’s a limit to how much he will do when it comes to prison reform if it gets in the way of his family and freedom. The conversation turned to prison reform when the host, Charlamagne Tha God tells Mill that when he talks about prison reform, that’s essentially messing with “the white man’s” money because private prisons are thriving businesses. Mill however said all he needs is a warning and he will step out of the way and curb his talk on prison reform. It would be recalled that Mill who has been to prison before has been on a mission to change the criminal justice system since his release from prison in April. He was so committed, he had planned to visit President Trump for a White House meeting but ended up canceling at Jay-Z’s request. Mill famously dated fellow rapper, Nicki Minaj but their relationship ended on a sour note with some name callings and accusations trailing the split. Just recently, Mill and Canadian rapper, Drake ended their three year feud. Drake described the end of the feud as “one of most electric and gratifying moments of my life.” Before then, the two rappers had, since 2015, traded insults online and through their music after Meek Mill accused Drake of not writing his own lyrics. After declaring their long-running feud over in the media, Drake made things official by sharing the stage for the first time with Meek Mill in front of a packed TD Garden crowd.
