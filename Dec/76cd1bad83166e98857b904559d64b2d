 [FILE] Dr. Bukola Saraki<br />Photo: Twitter/UcheSecondus  He said the party would not only sweep the elections in Kwara State, but also win the presidential election by the grace of God. Saraki, who asked his supporters not to be afraid of the use of federal might in the forthcoming general elections, said that he had confronted such situations in two previous elections and floored the incumbents. The Senate President spoke at the inauguration of a 42-man campaign council for the state PDP at ABS Constituency Office in Ilorin, the state capital. He said while the 2019 election, like any other election has its challenges, experience has shown that with the right tactics and strategies, the PDP would win the state again. He, however, asked members of the campaign council to demonstrate utmost good faith in the discharge of their duties to achieve the desired result. According to him, it is only when the PDP is in power at the federal level that things can return to normal for suffering Nigerians and the hopes of the people properly addressed. The state governor, Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed, expressed confidence that the PDP would win the state in 2019 “using that astute leadership of the Senate President as it has always been done since 2003.” Also, chairman of the campaign council, Prof. Suleiman Abubakar, in his acceptance speech on behalf of other members, described their appointment as a call to service at a critical period in the history of the state and promised to give all it takes to ensure success for the endeavour. Abukakar, who was Minister of National Planning during the 2015 elections, said Saraki truly defeated his team with its federal might in that election and expressed confidence that now that they are working together in the same party, things would turn out much better.
