Dr Chuba Wilberforce Okadigbo was born on this day in 1941 in Delta state to Anambra parents. He graduated with a Masters in Political Science from The Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. Desiring for more education, Chuba gained two doctorate degrees in Philosophy and Political Science. Okadigbo became an Assistant professor of Philosophy at the University of the District of Columbia and a professor of politics, Howard University. This was all between 1973 to 1975 and before the age of 34. In 1975, he returned to Nigeria where he became the director-general at the Centre for Interdisciplinary and Political Studies and a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. In 1979, he became appointed as the Political Adviser to the president, Shehu Shagari.
By the fourth republic, he became the senator representing Anambra North. By the time Nigeria became a democratic government, it was rumoured that Okadigbo was the chosen favourite for the position of Senate President. However, Evan Enwerem was voted in by the Senate. A little less than a year later, Enwerem was impeached based on corrupt practices and Okadigbo took over. In 2000, Okadigbo was charged with financial corruption and demoted to a senator. In 2002, Okadigbo ran with Muhammadu Buhari’s in 2003 Presidential elections under the All Nigeria Peoples Party. But Olusegun Obasanjo and Atiku Abubakar won this. One of his most memorable quotes is, “I think the first thing is to warn INEC to be careful. It is in their interest to be good neighbours to Nigerians and prove that the country was not a banana republic as the ruling party is making us believe. On the 25th of September 2003, a day after campaigning in Kano, he died from breathing problems.
