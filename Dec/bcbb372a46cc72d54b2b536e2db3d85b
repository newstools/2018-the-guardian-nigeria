The gale of defection hit the Imo State House of Assembly on Thursday as eighteen members have defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Speaker of the house, Acho Ihim, led the defecting lawmakers to a new party – Action Alliance (AA). The Speaker made the announcement of the defection on Thursday, during an emergency sitting at the Hallow chambers of the State House of Assembly in Owerri. Prior to their defection, there had been a tussle of supremacy between sectional groups of lawmakers in the assembly. The battle amongst the lawmakers also led to the failed impeachment of the current Imo state, Deputy governor, Eze Madumere. Madumere’s failed impeachment, in return, led to the suspension of five lawmakers Ifeanyi Nnatataonye, Uche Oguwuike, Donatus Onuigwe, kenna Nzeruo and Chiji Collins for unconstitutional activities by the speaker Acho Ihim. Other lawmakers whom the suspended lawmakers alleged that were offered money to support the impeachment plot of the deputy governor were also suspended from the House of Assembly. However, their suspension was nullified by Owerri High Court. Justice Goddy Anunihu said that their suspension did not follow due process, saying it amounted to “putting the horse before the cat.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
