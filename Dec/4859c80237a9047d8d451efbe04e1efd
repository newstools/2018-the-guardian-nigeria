About 277 students also graduated with various classes of degrees. The Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Isaac Rotimi Ajayi, said the convocation marked a decade of continuous success in the fulfilment of the mandate of the university in producing balanced and well-rounded graduates nurtured in academic and spiritual training and also found worthy in learning and character to hold the certificate of the university. He said: “This convocation is historic as our School of Part-time Studies is presenting its pioneer set of graduands and we are presenting a total of 304 graduating students for the award of first degrees and 27 for the award of postgraduate diplomas and masters degrees while prizes will be presented as usual to outstanding graduands. “It requires a lot of self-discipline to complete in any university programme. Having gone through the university, it is expected that the university must have equally passed through you by inculcating in you its culture of sound character, analytical reason and independent enquiry. “It is not the certificate that makes you a university product but the academic and professional skills.” However, former Director of the Centre of Excellence in Geosciences and Petroleum Engineering Studies, University of Benin (UNIBEN), Dr. Kehinde O. Ladipo, who delivered the convocation lecture, titled “The Dilemma of Opportunities Making Success of Life-Long Choices,” said that as fresh graduands of Crawford University, you are joining this workforce. Your challenge therefore is to be part of the transformation and it starts with you. This is an opportunity, which you must explore successfully. “As this university considers your degree as your passport into the future, cherish it. However, you must remember that shortly after today, you will be faced with dilemma of opportunities and how you make your choices that are just as important as the decisions you take. “Go into the future with hope and enthusiasm and with a strong belief that you will make it. Believe in yourself and draw on the inspiration from within and from others around you, both young and old. “Be open to new learning and persevere. Be determined to be one of the success stories of your Alma Mater, Crawford University, your family and your country.” Meanwhile, the overall best student, Akinyemi Oluwatobi Dominion, who received 10 prizes in different categories and passed out with First Class honour with CGPA of 4.96 in Biological Science, congratulated the newly-graduated students for their success in the university. He said: “To everything, there is a season and this is our season.” He, however, urged the Federal Government to pay more attention to private universities.
