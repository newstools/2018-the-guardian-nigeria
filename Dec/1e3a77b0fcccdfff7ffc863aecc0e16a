 Director General, NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Christianah Adeyeye  Adeyeye, who disclosed the alarming figure yesterday during the flag off of youths Against Drug Abuse Campaign held in Kano, hinted that recent survey revealed that prescription drugs abuse are fast-emerging public health challenges especially in Northern Nigeria. Also in Kano, wife of the President, Aisha Buhari and Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday advocated cultural and family reorientation as major panacea towards addressing the endemic drug abuse in the country. While Buhari preferred tackling the root cause rather than criminalising the abuse of the substance, the emir however agitated for drastic measure, including appropriate sanctions against abusers and peddlers. Adeyeye regretted that young girls and women in Kano are deeply involved in hard drugs, calling on family support to inculcate cultural and religious values in children in order to guide them. Similarly, the National Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Kano Command, said it has seized illicit drugs to the tune of 10 tons between January and December 2018. Commander in-charge of Kano, Ibrahim Adamu made the disclosure yesterday at a press briefing held in Kano. Sanusi attributed the growing abuse of drugs in Kano to poverty, unemployment, out of school children and population explosion, urged concerned authorities to tighten security of borders to check smuggling of tramadol and other illicit drugs coming into the country.
