 [FILE PHOTO] Captain Ahmed Gasmi scored six minutes into stoppage time to snatch a CAF Confederation Cup play-off place for NA Hussein Dey of Algeria on Saturday at the expense of Zambian club Green Eagles.  Hussein Dey, competing in the second-tier African club competition for the first time since 2006, won 2-1 in Algiers to qualify after a goalless round-of-32 first leg last weekend. Collins Mulenga had given Eagles, playing in Africa for the first time this year, an early lead that Gasmi cancelled before half-time by converting a penalty. Hussein Dey were the most dramatic overall winners on a day when eight other clubs also secured places in the December 28 play-offs draw. Asante Kotoko of Ghana, who have the unwanted record of seven losses in nine CAF finals, edged Kariobangi Sharks of Kenya 2-1 in Kumasi after the first leg ended goalless. Fatawu Safiu put Kotoko ahead and Patilah Omoto levelled for Sharks with a thunderbolt before Amos Frimpong converted a 40th-minute penalty for the local club that settled the tie. Salitas, who recently completed their first season in the Burkina Faso first division, followed up a shock 2-0 away win over Al Masry of Egypt by drawing 0-0 in Ouagadougou. The goalless second leg sufficed to send the Burkinabe outfit into the play-offs and eliminate Masry, who were Confederation Cup semi-finalists last season. Renaissance Berkane and trophy-holders Raja Casablanca of Morocco, South African side Kaizer Chiefs, Kampala Capital City Authority of Uganda, Rwandan club Mukura Victory and San Pedro of the Ivory Coast also qualified. A further five second legs are scheduled for Sunday.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
