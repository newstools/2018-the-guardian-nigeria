The former president of the United States, Barack Obama has apparently had a busy year especially when it comes to entertaining himself — because he has just shared a long list of his favourite songs, films and books. On the lists, he has 22 songs (and a jazz album) that feature tracks by J. Cole, Janelle Monae, Cardi B and 2 from Jay-Z “Wow Freestyle” feat. Kendrick Lamar and “Apes**t” which features Beyonce. For film, he shares his top 15 films of the year which range from blockbuster hits like “Black Panther” to critical darlings like “Eighth Grade” and early Oscar buzz films like “If Beale Street Could Talk.” He also lists the Mr. Rogers documentary, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” As for his favourite books, he breaks his alphabetical format to list his wife Michelle Obama’s book, “Becoming,” as number one and includes the note, “obviously my favorite!” Another notable book is Nelson Mandela’s “Long Walk to Freedom” as well as Nigerian writer, Chimamanda Adichie’s “Americannah”.
