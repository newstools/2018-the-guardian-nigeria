Government has been urged to pass a law that protects the rights of people living with disabilities to access employment, quality healthcare, education as well as protection from sexual abuse. Stakeholders made the call at an event on ‘Improving access to sexual assault response and support services for persons with disabilities (PWDs)’ organised by Partnership for Justice, in collaboration with Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption (ROLAC), Policy Dialogue Programme. They noted that state governments have failed to pass disability law, which has made life difficult for persons with disabilities. Executive Director, Centre for Citizens Living with Disabilities (CCD), Mr. David Anyaele, said 70 per cent of people living with disabilities do not have basic education, due to government’s inability to assist them. Mrs. Itoro Eze-Anaba from Partnership for Justice/Mirabel Centre, said government should properly implement the law protecting the rights of people living with disabilities.  She explained that when the rights of this group are violated, they are often not bold to report to the Police.
