Angelina Jolie might just be the first woman to occupy the White House as president. The award-winning actress and humanitarian isn’t as opposed to entering the political world as she used to be. Jolie was asked yesterday by a BBC reporter if she would consider running for president and she didn’t exactly say “No” to the idea. Although the “Maleficent” star has been a UN Ambassador for years, the actress was asked about her aspirations going forward during an interview with BBC’s Today radio show yesterday December 28. Host, Justin Webb brought up Donald Trump making the leap from entertainment to the White House, he noted that while he’s “not necessarily getting you to run for president,” he wondered if she was “moving in a direction of politics. Jolie replied, “Honestly, if you asked me 20 years ago, I would have laughed. I always say I’ll go where I’m needed, I don’t know if I’m fit for politics but then I’ve also joked that I don’t know if I have a skeleton left in my closet so I’m pretty open and out there. I can take a lot on the chin, so that’s good.” She also said her position with the UN already allows her to work directly with people in need, governments and militaries “without it being about myself or my policies.” She added, “For now, I’ll stay quiet.” When Webb said he’d put her name “somewhere on the list of Democrats” running for president in 2020, she simply said “Thank you,” with a laugh. Webb then pointed out that she didn’t say “No,” before the interview came to an end. Watch the video below: Will Angelina Jolie run for president one day?
