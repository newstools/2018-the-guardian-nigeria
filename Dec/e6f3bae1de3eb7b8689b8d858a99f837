 [FILE PHOTO] Adams Oshiomhole,  APC leader  Speaking to journalists at a defection rally held in Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, Udeogaranya said he left APC because of injustice meted to him and other members by the leadership of the party, adding that PDP was ready to take back power at the centre and other states, especially those he described as its traditional states. Udeogaranya commended Nigerians across board for their overwhelming support and solidarity with the repositioned PDP, saying: “The interests and movements from the APC to the PDP are indicators of the consensus by Nigerians to rally on the platform of the PDP to end the economic hardship, bloodletting, violence and infrastructural decay that have become the hallmark of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration and return Nigeria to the path of unity, national cohesion and economic prosperity.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
