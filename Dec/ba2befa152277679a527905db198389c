Nigerian senator Shehu Sani said the political elites in the country’s north were keeping mum over the level of insecurity in the region for selfish reasons. “Northern political elites are silent on the frequent killings and kidnappings in the north out of any of these three reasons,” Sani said in a tweet on Monday. “FEAR not to be seen opposing the Government; BELIEF that the President is doing his best; INDIFFERENCE because it’s the poor that are dying,” he added. This came less than 24hours after Sani said that crises between local farmers and herdsmen in Kaduna State were yet to be resolved. Earlier this year, some residents of the state had to flee their homes due to local farmers and herdsmen crisis, which the government claimed have been resolved. “There is herder crisis in Kaduna; there are killings and kidnappings,” Sani said in a tweet on Sunday. “Visit Birnin Gwari and parts of southern Kaduna, listen to the orphans, the widows and the families of the victims.” Prior to Sani’s alert, Kaduna residents had observed 24-hour curfew on two occasions in October due to religious crises.
