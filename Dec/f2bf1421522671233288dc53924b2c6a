Milan have said they will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after UEFA threatened to ban them from European competition for a season if they do not break even by June 2021. The club won a previous appeal to CAS earlier this year, following a Europa League ban for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. But their efforts to secure European football for next season suffered a setback against a resolute Frosinone outfit who almost snatched a dramatic 93rd-minute winner when Camillo Ciano was denied by visiting goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Ciano had already seen a goal ruled out by VAR for a foul eight minutes before half-time. Frosinone remain second-bottom above only winless Chievo, having managed just one victory all season. Later on Wednesday, reigning champions Juventus travel to Atalanta looking to extend their eight-point lead at the top of the table, before second-placed Napoli face third-placed Inter Milan.
