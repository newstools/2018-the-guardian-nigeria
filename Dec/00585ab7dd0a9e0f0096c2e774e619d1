 [FILE PHOTO] Middle-aged man, simply known as Davy, has died in a popular hotel in Ikotun area of Lagos State during a sex competition with a lady identified as Loveth.  It was gathered that the late Davy had argued with Loveth on who can last longer in a sex bout. Both claimed they were stronger and refused to admit defeat. During the argument, Davy staked N50,000 on the condition that if Loveth defeats him during the romp, she will take the money. Loveth agreed, moved into the hotel and booked for a chalet. It was gathered that while the marathon sex lasted, Davy pulled through to the sixth round but Loveth was unshaken till the seventh round when he collapsed and died on top of her. She then raised the alarm and contacted the hotel management, who handed her over to the Ikotun Police Division while the body of the deceased was deposited at an undisclosed hospital for autopsy. Loveth was later transferred to the SCIID Panti, Yaba, where she told investigators what transpired between her and the late Davy. Thefate of Loveth will depend on the outcome of the autopsy.
