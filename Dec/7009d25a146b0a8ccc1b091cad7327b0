Okeke told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the telephone from Johannesburg, South Africa, that there was the need for the team’s handlers to reorganise the team. “We rejoice with Nigerians on the spectacular victory by the Falcons. Winning the African women’s football title nine times is not easy. “But we appeal to the handlers of the team to take stock of the tournament and reorganise the team,’’ he said. Okeke said Nigeria would achieve success at the 2019 female FIFA World Cup in France if the handlers introduce young and talented players into the team. “We observed during the tournament that some of the Super Falcons players are no longer young. “So, it is important to introduce new players into the team before the World Cup,” he said. The chairman also urged the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) to start early preparation for the World Cup by organising friendly international matches for the Super Falcons. He commended the NFF for paying the players their bonuses throughout the tournament in Ghana.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
