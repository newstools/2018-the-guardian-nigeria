Rapper Cardi B has taken to Instagram to let the world know what she misses about her estranged husband, Offset. If you think it’s his personality, you guessed wrong because the mother of one is making it clear that what she misses is his manhood. Cardi B who has never been shy about letting intimate aspects of her life known to the public took to Instagram live and delivered a hilarious clip while sipping coffee. Painting a graphic image of her bedroom life with Offset, she revealed just how much she wants Offset’s member in and around her mouth, and pretty much any place else you can think of. The “I Like It” rapper who spoke in graphic language didn’t, however, mention whether they are getting back together other than talks about missing their amazing sex life. This clip is coming on the heels of the ongoing drama in their marriage after she announced their split on Instagram some few days back. It would be recalled that rumours surfaced Offset was planning threesome sex with two other women, Summer Bunni and Cuban Doll. Since the split, Offset has been attempting to win his wife. From crashing her Rolling Stone set to sending her N5,475,000 ($15,000) of roses to public apologies. It waits to be seen if the rap couple will be able to settle their differences and become a family once again. Cardi B and Offset share a daughter, Kulture and they got married in a low-key wedding last year.
