University of Ibadan Women Society (UIWS) has urged parents to diversify the learning opportunities of their children early in life.President of the society, Eyiwumi Olayinka, during a children’s Christmas party in Ibadan, said due to advancement in technology, “children of this generation have the ability to comprehend faster,” therefore should by all means be exposed to different learning grounds. Olayinka, who is also the wife of the vice chancellor, said the women society had developed pre-school learning schemes to teach children foreign languages like French and German, as well as expose them to new developments in sciences, music, arts and technology. “The world is progressing; so it is very pertinent for our children to keep up with trends, so as to be on the same level with their global counterparts,” she said. She also highlighted that some children were already going through agro-vocational training for food processing and packaging where they make cassava, maize and plantain chips. This, she said, will enable them be self-employed in the future. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
