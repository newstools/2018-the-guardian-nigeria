For four days, Accra, the capital city of Ghana was beehive of activities, as music stars and stakeholders in the African showbiz industry stormed the Gold Coast for the fifth edition of the All Africa Music Award (AFRIMA). Right from the arrival of guests into Accra, the Internet kept buzzing with social media posts from celebrities, who were obviously impressed with the new Terminal 3 of the Kotoka International Airport. For a country, which is eager to play big in MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, Exhibition) tourism, this is indeed a major leap. Unlike previous editions in Lagos where attention was mostly focused on the main award ceremony, this year’s programme was packed with invigorating activities, which had invited guests and artistes from across the continent, Europe, North America and Middle East fully engaged through their stay in the gold coast city of Accra, Ghana. The Republic of Ghana through the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture, Ghana hosted the 2018 edition.

The Africa Music Business Summit (AMBS) took centre stage on the second day of the festival, where music executives, professionals, Intellects and enthusiasts had interactive discussions and networking on issues surrounding the business of music in Africa.

The AFRIMA team and guest then visited the St. Thomas Presbyterian Primary School in Osu Town, Accra, where AFRIMA carried out its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity. Here, AFRIMA presented the school with lots of reading items and school materials including computer sets, Piano set, Guitar set, and drum set, all brand new. The nominees and guests had fun time with students, in a game of dance and singing competition. The entourage was then ushered to the Jubilee House on a courtesy visit to the Presidency, where the Chief of Staff, Akosua Frema Osei-Opare in the absence of the President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, received them. Accompanied by Honourable Catherine Afeku, with Veteran Ghanaian Highlife Musician, Nana Ampadu, the Chief of Staff reiterated the interest of Government of Ghana in hosting ARIMA for the next years (2019 & 2020) before it is moved to another African City. It was a merry congregation, as it had all attending AFRIMA Nominees, past winners and other African artiste attending the music awards. In the evening of the same day was the Official AFRIMA Nominees’ Party, held at Carbon Lounge, Accra, in partnership with CIROC and hosted by Universal Music. All nominees, artiste managers, and music executives came together in a frenzied atmosphere as this gave room for artiste to interact and exchange contacts with their counterparts, paving room for future relationships and possible collaborations.
