Runtown was slammed with a N14 Million suit for a no-show at the Harmattan Carnival. The case, Suit No LD/ADR/251/2015, was filed on the 19th August 2015 by the Anambra group through its leader, Mr Chizuo Anetoh. The group dragged Runtown, Ericmany Entertainment and Prince Okwudili Umenyiora-the Chairman of Dilly Motors Limited- before the Lagos High Court. The Anambra group asked for the sum of N14 Million as damages for failure of Runtown to perform at their Harmattan Carnival held at Adazi-Nnukwu, Anaocha in Anambra State. According to Ericmany lawyers, the Anambra group first breached the contract having failed to provide all the required arrangements for the artist-Runtown. Due to the Christmas period, Ericmany’s crew had to sort out late hour flight tickets to Port Harcourt instead of Asaba or Owerri nearer to the Anaocha venue of the carnival. However, upon landing in Port Harcourt it was late to proceed on a dangerous road without adequate security, Ericmany’s lawyer claimed. During the trial on the 10th May 2018, Mr Aneto testified for the Anambra group. He narrated how Runtown flew from Lagos to Port Harcourt but refused to proceed on the journey to Adazi venue, even after they provided a police escort for him at the airport. Hon. Justice K. O. Alogba found that the failure of Runtown to get to Adazi in Anambra State and perform at the carnival was justified as the group’s arrangement was very shoddy. The Court agreed with Ericmany that the Dynamic Minds League was reckless about the contract when it failed to book flight tickets ahead. Also, the Court also held that the group did not prove how they are entitled to their N14 Million claim as it did not adduce cogent evidence. Each of the claims was therefore dismissed
