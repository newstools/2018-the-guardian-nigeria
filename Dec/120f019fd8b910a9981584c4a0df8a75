The couple, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, held a traditional pre-wedding ceremony which is called Mehendi. A Mehendi ceremony is a Hindu wedding rite that typically happens one or two days . Priyanka shared images of the colourful ceremony on her Instagram page.   One of the most special things that our relationship has given us is a merging of families who love and respect each otherâ€™s faiths and cultures. And so planning our wedding with an amalgamation of both was so so amazing. An important part of the pre wedding rituals for the girl in an Indian wedding is the Mehendi. Once again we made it our own and it was an afternoon that kicked off the celebrations in the way we both dreamed. @nickjonas A post shared by  Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Dec 1, 2018 at 7:31am PST The bride wore a forty-eight multi-panelled organdy sherwani embellished in silk detailing with two organza layered drapes for the ceremony.
