• NFF assures nation of team’s preparation
There are indications that the nation may not achieve its dreams of making it to next year’s FIFA U-17 World Cup if the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) fails to address the discrepancy in the coaches’ salaries before the 2019 African U-17 Championship billed to hold in Tanzania. Sources close to some of the coaches told The Guardian at the weekend that the assistant trainers are displeased with the meagre monthly allowances paid to them by the NFF because “it is far below what others get.” Specifically, the assistant coaches are not happy that Chief Coach, Manu Garba is on a N1 million monthly salary, while they are paid only N100, 000 each. The source believes the gap in the coaches’ salaries could affect their performance as they begin preparation for the U-17 championship. “The salary given to head coach, who is on a contract is far above the allowances given to the assistants coaches of the Golden Eaglets. I don’t think this situation is good for the team, as some of the coaches are complaining bitterly over the discrepancies in the money given to them. “The Eaglets will open camp soon and I am pleading with the NFF to increase the allowances paid to the coaches and also place them on contract. In the game of football, it is not only the head coach that builds a team. The assistant coaches also contribute to the team’s success. For the Golden Eaglets to excel in the African U-17 Championship, the NFF needs to ensure that the coaches and players are in the right frame of mind,” the source said. Reacting to the coaches’ complaints, the NFF Secretary General, Mohammad Sanusi said the allowances and salaries are not subject for public discourse, adding that when an employer and his employees agree on salaries, they don’t invite a third party. “The NFF is not aware of any grudge in the Eaglets’ camp. The salary of coaches is between the federation and the coaches. I don’t have to come to your office and ask your employer what he is paying you; it is between the two of you and there is no third party involved. “This practice is done everywhere in the world. Our coaches are working according to our agreement and I don’t know where you got your information from. Before any coach is employed in the NFF, there are discussions and agreements before he is allowed to handle any team. The coach is not forced on the job,” he said. Sanusi assured that the NFF would give the Eaglets the best preparations before the African U-17 Championship next year. The Golden Eaglets are in Group A alongside host nation, Tanzania, Angola and debutants, Uganda in the preliminary round of the 2019 Africa U-17 Cup of Nations.
