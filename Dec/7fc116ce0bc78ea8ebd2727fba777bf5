He also announced the setting up of a three-man fact finding committee to look into the allegations levelled against Eleti. Fadeyi said the Vice Chairman of the party, Mrs Olufunke Adu would take over as acting chairman of the party pending the determination of the allegations against Eleti. Members of the three-man committee set up to investigate Eleti are: Mr Kunle Ogunniyi,the Assistant Legal Adviser of the party in the area, Mr Emmanuel Olubi, chairman of chairmen of all wards and Mr Afolayan Omotayo, Ex-officio. According to Fadeyi, the party at the local government level met to review the activities of the party before during and after the primaries and found the chairman wanting in some areas. “The Executive committee members after discussions and deliberations discovered that some party officials acted against the conduct and outcome of the Oct. 6 party primaries. “For instance, specific allegations of gross abuse of office, financial impropriety, negligence and dereliction of duty, an act capable of bringing the party into ridicule were found against Mr Joshua Eleti, our chairman,” he said. Mrs Olufunke Adu, the acting chairman of the party in the area, promised to work to the best of her ability and according to the constitution of the party. Eleti, in his reaction, dismissed the suspension slammed on him, saying he was never present at the meeting where he was purportedly suspended. He maintained that he still remains the chairman of the party in the area, describing the suspension as “a charade”.
