According to the Lagos police spokesman, Chike Oti, “unfortunately for madam, the house-help had carefully planned how to kidnap her children, a six-year-old boy and three-year-old girl, which she executed effortlessly because she is known to the school authorities and familiar with the children. “Investigation so far revealed that Busayo is a member of a kidnap syndicate who gives her out as housemaid to unsuspecting parents. When she finally lands the job, she warms her way into the children’s heart and wins the trust of her employers.
