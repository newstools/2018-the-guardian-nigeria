She said more than 258 million migrants “today live outside their home countries of birth due to conflicts.” She noted that the world was in its highest point of transition and, therefore, needed immediate action to curb populism, rising nationalism sentiments and displacements. “People leave their homes fleeing bombs, and nearly one person was displaced every two seconds last year,” she said. According to Espinosa, there is need for a stronger multilateral system, “and states can still come together to make progress.” She explained that her preoccupation as president of the General Assembly was (managing) young people, just as she noted, “the world is in no shortage of crises.” While the major challenges of cyber security and climate change subsist, Espinosa said the international community needed to “do more to support intermediation and conflict resolution.” Somalian Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire said countries must work together to avert another economic meltdown, as predicted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
