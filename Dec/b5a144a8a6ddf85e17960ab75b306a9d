 Ajoke Ojomu  Ojomu, a 400 level Physical and Health Education student at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), believes she would reign supreme as national top seed, if there are regular tournaments to engage the players. She said the Abuja 2018 National Sports Festival was a replication of national championship, pointing out that: “the sports festival brought out who is who in all categories amongst our national players, home and abroad, in table tennis. “I would have loved to meet Funke Oshonaike, and I would have beaten her, but she was defeated earlier in the quarterfinal. If the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) decide to organise top 20 to determine the best amongst the men and women, I am sure I will maintain the top position among the women because I know my capabilities.” Ojomu whipped Nimota Aregbesola of Lagos state 4-1 in the ladies semifinal, after the latter had ousted Oshonaike. She forged ahead to hand Cecilia Otu-Akpan of Cross River state another 4-1 defeat in the final to grab the Festival gold medal. “I believe I can rule Africa and the Commonwealth, if the national team handlers do not politicise the selection of players for the national assignments,” she stated.Ojomu entered the ping-pong game six years ago after knee injury knocked down her career in football.
