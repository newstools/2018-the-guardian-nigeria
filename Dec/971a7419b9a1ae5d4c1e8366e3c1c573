What would your reaction be if you get a hold of Justin Bieber’s phone number? Fans of Justin Bieber may have just gotten that experience when a phone number that many believe belongs to him was shared via his Twitter account. The phone number was sent out on Christmas Eve and for about ten minutes, Beliebers could not stop freaking out about the tweet. The tweet read, “Had to change it,” Bieber cryptically tweeted on December 24. “Hit me at +505 5853 1341. I’m on WhatsApp too.” Although it is unconfirmed, many believe he was hacked but less than ten minutes later, the tweet was mysteriously deleted. This is the second time recently that something like this happened on Bieber’s account, as over the weekend, someone hacked his Twitter and posted a phone number. It’s unclear if the number actually belongs to Bieber, or if the hacker is just trolling us. After the incident, many fans also commented that they don’t need his phone number but new music. This is understandable considering he hasn’t released new music in 2018 as he has been focusing on his personal life more than his career. It is also noteworthy that it has been more than three years since Justin released a full-length album. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
