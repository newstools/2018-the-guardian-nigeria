The party therefore called appropriate authorities to fish out those responsible for the attack with immediate effect. It also frowned at the bourgeoning culture of executive recklessness, intimidation and dictatorship in the nation’s polity at a time Nigeria’s democracy should be maturing. ADC insists that Governor Ibikunke Amosun and President Muhammadu Buhari should be held accountable for any loss of lives, and breach of peace, owing to the wanton breach of the peace and neglect by security agencies. In a statement, yesterday, National Publicity Secretary of ADC, Mrs. Yemi Kolapo, said such violent attacks should not be allowed to derail Nigeria’s fledgling democracy. She said ADC would not allow itself to be intimidated at any level by people who could only be enemies of democracy. She stated: “The campaign team of Isiaka, was attacked at Ibese, in Yewa North, Ogun State. Our people and thousands of supporters were prevented from holding a peaceful rally in the most ugly manner, while two party members were shot and are in critical condition. Many others also sustained serious injuries. “This ignoble culture of intimidation and dictatorship must be discontinued if we must save our democracy. Every political party in Nigeria should be allowed free access to main events centres. There must be no preferential treatment for any political party and government should guarantee safety of lives and property without bias for any group.” The party called on law enforcement agencies to commit their professional training to serving the interest of the entire populace and contributing their quota to rebuilding the nation. “They should refrain from being tools in the hands of the people in power at the moment. The ugly scenario that culminated in the swearing in of a governor with stolen mandate in Osun State is still fresh in the minds of Nigerians, and citizens must rise up to say ‘No’ to all forms of electoral corruption and violence,” ADC said.
