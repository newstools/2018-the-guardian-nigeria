The Special Adviser Media and Publicity to the Senate president, Yusuph Olaniyonu, has described the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to sign any more constitutional amendment bill as “politics of vendetta”. “Since he rejected the PIGB a few months ago, I knew he will, in fact, not sign ANY bill till the end of his tenure. Politics of vendetta,” Olaniyonu tweeted on Tuesday. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Ita Enang, said Buhari had drawn the curtains on the signing of bills for the fourth alteration to the 1999 Constitution. “If the President has not signed any bill as of today – and he must have written the National Assembly informing them – it is because the time allowed by law has elapsed,” Enang said. “It is no more available for signing. And I know that the President assented to some of the bills that were submitted and sent the rest back to the National Assembly,” he added Both the Senate and the House of Representatives spent at least N1bn of taxpayers’ money between 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 on the fourth alteration of the 1999 constitution. Enang also affirmed the time assigned to constitutional amendment has elapsed and “the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives must have been communicated.” Initially, the Senate and the House proposed 33 amendments to the constitution, but both chambers only mutually passed 17 of the bills. The 17 bills were later forwarded to the 36 state Houses of Assembly for approval in compliance with Section 9 of the constitution. But Buhari had so far signed only five.
