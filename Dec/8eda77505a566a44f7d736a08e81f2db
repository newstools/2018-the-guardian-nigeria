Fans of late rapper, Mac Miller have another reason to celebrate his life and music as he has been nominated for his first Grammy. Miller who is up for “Rap Album of the Year” will be going up against some heavyweights like Cardi B (Invasion of Privacy), Travis Scott (Astroworld), Nipsey Hussle (Victory Lap), and Pusha T (Daytona). Tha announcement that Miller’s “Swimming” album is up for the award was made today by the Recording Academy. It would be recalled that “Swimming” peaked at number three on the Billboard charts when it was released back in August. It returned to the top 10 following Miller’s death in September. “Swimming” got rave reviews, including one from Rolling Stone which said Miller revealed “himself to be a sympathetic, even winning presence.” Miller who prior to his death dated Ariana Grande died of an overdose. His split from the “God Is A Woman” crooner has been attributed by some fans to be one of the many reasons he overdosed. Shortly after their breakup, Grande began dating Saturday Night Life comedian, Pete Davidson whom she later got engaged to. Davidson and Grande however called off the engagement last month. In November, Grande released a hit song, “Thank U, Next” which is a thank you song to some of her exes. In the song, she mentions Miller whom she has been mourning. It is also speculated that Miller’s death played a role in her split from Davidson.
