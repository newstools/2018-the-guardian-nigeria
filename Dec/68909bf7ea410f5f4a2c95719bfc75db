 Osuji  Osuji, who has so far spent millions of naira through borrowing and support from friends and family members since he was admitted in the hospital, can no longer walk on his own. He now moves with clutches. What started as a mere malaria and typhoid fever when he was diagnosed in the hospital showed a case of ulcer, which was dripping blood inside his system leading to darkening of his faeces. He was treated and everything became normal but three weeks after being discharged, he encountered crisis and returned to the hospital. Another round of treatment started, which forced the hospital to conduct a comprehensive test on him. Meanwhile, Osuji, who has exhausted his money and all avenues to raise funds closed, is now trapped and held by the hospital due to his inability to pay for his accumulated bills. He, therefore, seeks urgent help to undergo more tests, settle hospital bills and seek medical help abroad. His details are phone number: 08035569661; and account number 6237381300, Fidelity Bank.
