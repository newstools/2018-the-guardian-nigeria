Investors returned to buying after the long-awaited meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of weekend G20 talks in Argentina. The leaders of the world’s top two economies agreed not to impose new tariffs and to continue talking, lowering the temperature of a conflict that has spooked world markets. “In addition to the sense of relief following the US-China summit, the rise of Shanghai and Hong Kong stocks helped investors seek to buy shares in the afternoon trade,” Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online Securities, said in a commentary. Under the US-China agreement, Trump shelved a plan to raise existing tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent from the start of next year. But the White House said the tariffs would still leap up to 25 percent if China does not meet US demands in 90 days.
