Baptism is a religious ritual based on the Christian faith that cleanses the sins of the baptised. While carrying out this ritual, in Accra Ghana, a 20-year-old man drowned while being baptised by a pastor in a river. The young man, Yaw Kyeremeh was reportedly standing at the bank of River Densu with the pastor who carried out the baptism.
