Ahead of 2019 general elections, the Senator representing Kaduna Central Zone and human rights activist, Shehu Sani has inaugurated an inter-religious and ethnic peace roundtable in Kaduna State to address the problem of religious crisis in the North that can threaten nation’s democracy. According to Sani, “the initiative is an intervention aimed at finding lasting peace in Northern states affected by sectarian and religious conflicts. Also, Sani was conferred with an Award of Excellence by members of the ECWA Church, Bishara 1 Parish in Mararaban Rido, Kaduna, where he pledged to champion the war against religious violence, which some unscrupulous people may use to derail the nation’s democracy and threaten the country’s peace and unity. Sani said initiative would break the wall that separates Muslims from Christians. He said: It is aimed at finding lasting peace in states bedeviled with sectarian violence particularly in Northern Nigeria.” “It’s to build spiritual and moral bridges in communities in conflict and divided by conflicts. It’s to encourage peace-makers and peace-builders to do more to combat intolerance and extremism and it’s associated violence.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
