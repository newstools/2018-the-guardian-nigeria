Celebrity couple, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are many fans’ coupe goals for a lot of reasons but one that stands out is the undeniable love that they share. For this year’s Christmas celebration, West decided to surprise his wife and the mother of his three children with a N5,096,000,000 ($14 million) condo. It is gathered that West made a deal to buy a mega-unit in a super, super exclusive Miami Beach condo building, dubbed “Billionaire Beach Bunker”. According to a report by TMZ and Page Six, the 18-story building is occupied by hedge fund gazillionaires and ridiculously rich land developers. It is further learnt that West who made the Christmas present a surprise scoped the place out on his own while in town for Art Basel, and Kim had never even seen it. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-822202 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Condo-Photo-Getty-Images.png" alt="" width="1280" height="936" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Condo-Photo-Getty-Images.png 922w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Condo-Photo-Getty-Images-818x598.png 818w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Condo-Photo-Getty-Images-487x356.png 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Condo-Photo-Getty-Images-320x234.png 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Condo-Photo-Getty-Images-640x468.png 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Condo-Photo-Getty-Images-600x439.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> It is also learnt that West secretly made the offer this month and surprised his wife with it on Christmas day.  The condo is made up of  4,700 square feet with 4 bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths and an insanely large terrace. The building is tricked out with a gym, pool and spa and also right on the beach. The best part is that he got a deal out of the condo as it was originally listed at N5,642,000,000 ($15.5 million). It is also noteworthy that West has fairly deep ties to the city. He’s a regular at the Basel while Kim also did a show there, “Kourtney & Kim Take Miami.”
