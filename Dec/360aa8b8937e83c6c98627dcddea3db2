And the award for the weird description of Thanos goes to… Popular streaming platform, Netflix, recently stated what they think about Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War’s villain, Thanos and it is pretty… villainish. While talking about the film, the streaming service described Thanos as an “Intergalactic Sociopath”. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-821219 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-1126x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1126" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-1126x1152.jpg 1126w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-585x598.jpg 585w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-487x498.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-974x996.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-235x240.jpg 235w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-469x480.jpg 469w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos-587x600.jpg 587w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Netflix-on-Thanos.jpg 1173w" sizes="(max-width: 1126px) 100vw, 1126px" /> This description has Marvel fans reacting on social media “Intergalactic sociopath” is a bold description choice for Thanos, Netflix. — Brian Coulter (@PhilaBCoulter) December 26, 2018  The fact that the Netflix description of Infinity War describes Thanos as an “intergalactic sociopath” may very literally be the funniest thing I’ve heard all year — kaitlynn (@k_leigh24) December 25, 2018  “Intergalactic sociopath Thanos” yeah that about sums it up — mia | GAMORA  (@cherishedmcu) December 26, 2018  You have psychopath & sociopath backwards. Sociopaths should no conscious or emotions for their actions. Psychopaths do show emotion & remorse but continue to act on their impulses. @MarvelStudios know this. However, thanos is still HIGHLY overrated. https://t.co/52iO4LHceX — PrideandPrejudice (@JaneLizzyBennet) December 26, 2018
