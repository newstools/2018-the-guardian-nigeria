Speaker of House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara. Nigeria’s House of Representative Thursday approved Nigeria June 12 as the new Democracy Day for the country. The approval followed the adoption of a report on a bill seeking to amend the Public Holidays Act 2004. Considering the report at the plenary, the lawmakers approved the amendments to three clauses ‎in the Act, as recommended in the report. One of the clauses deleted May 29 as Democracy Day and replaced the date with June 12. In June, President Muhammadu Buhari directed that the National Democracy Day will be shifted from May 29 to June 12 with the conferment of a posthumous honorary award to the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993, general elections, Moshood Kashimawo Olawale(MKO) Abiola.
