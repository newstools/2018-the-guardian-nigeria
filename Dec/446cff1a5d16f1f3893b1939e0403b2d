Tanzanian regulatory arts board, Basata has banned Diamond Platnumz from performing after he performed one of his songs that was banned a few weeks ago due to its ‘immoral’ content. The singer who made ‘bongo flava,’ Tanzanian hip-hop popular, performed one of his song Mwanza at a festival in the port city of Mwanza. The song Mwanza was banned because it contained sexual lyrics, Swahili word for “horny” and authorities say that some of the dance moves displayed in the song were lewd and inappropriate.  In a statement from Basata, Diamond Platinumz and another artist, Rayvanny featured in the track has been banned from performing outside Tanzania. However, it is unclear how this can be achieved. It is unclear what this will mean for the artist’s career. Diamond Platnumz real name Naseeb Abdul Juma is one of the top musicians in Africa and has recorded hits like Number One in which he featured Davido. He has collaborated with a lot of other famous acts like Waje and Iyanya. He has been nominated for several awards and has won some as well. He bagged the award for MTV Africa Awards for Best Live Act in his “Diamond” performance. Tanzania is a country that is concerned with maintaining moral values and ensuring that it is instilled in her citizens. A few months ago they had banned members of parliament from wearing coloured wigs, fake eyelashes and fixing artificial nails.
