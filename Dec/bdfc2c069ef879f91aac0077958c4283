Controversial talk show host, Wendy Williams has warned Kim Kardashian about a recent beauty confession. The 38-year old Kardashian while making an appearance on “Busy Tonight” had admitted that she sometimes tried to “salvage” her makeup, eapecially when she doesn’t have a glam squad on deck. Williams however thinks that the makeup confession could be a ploy to sell a new KKW Beauty product. 54-year-old Williams then went on to give Kim this warning “Keeping your makeup on causes clogged pores, it causes rough skin, and it’s going to catch up with you,” the talk show host warned on her show, December 12. “It won’t catch up with her [Kim] because she has makeup artists on call all the time, I don’t believe that,” Wendy added, explaining that Kim most likely has ulterior motives. “She’s probably trying to sell something in her line, you know, something permanent — a type of makeup and you guys will buy it,” Wendy said. “She’s hypnotizing you now by telling you, ‘This is what I do.’” It is noteworthy that Kim made her now viral beauty confession while sitting down with Busy Philipps on her new late night show on December 9. “Have you ever slept with your makeup on?”, Philipps asked. And, just when viewers thought Kim would go on a beauty rant about the effects of healthy skin, she admitted instead, “Oh, all the time. Like even if I can’t have glam the next day, I’ll sleep perfectly and maybe I’ll redo my skin, but I try to salvage it for two days.” It would be recalled that just recently, Kim defended her husband, Kanye West’s statement that slavery is a choice. According to her, he never said that and the tape was edited to make it appear that was what he said during his interview with TMZ Live.
