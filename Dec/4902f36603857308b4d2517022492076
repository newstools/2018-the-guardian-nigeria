 Chief Tony Okoroji  COSON said on Monday said that after reading the #NextLevelNG manifesto of the APC and #TheAtikuPlan manifesto of the PDP, it was shocked that none of the candidates have plans to grow or develop the talent that exists in the Nigerian creative industry such as music, movies, theatre, fashion, content, and so on. The body said that the lack of strong policy positions in the area was evidence of the disconnect between the leadership and the followership in Nigeria. COSON has announced that the organization is inviting serious politicians to the COSON Arena to come and educate stakeholders in the creative industry on their plans to deploy the assets that the country has in the creative direction. It is the interaction of the industry with the politicians that will determine whom the thousands of members of COSON will endorse, support and campaign for and recommend to their fans to vote for. Speaking on the decision, COSON Chairman, Chief Tony Okoroji said, “We are no longer going to stand on the sidelines. This is the era of the knowledge and creative economy and we will do whatever is necessary to make sure that our country is not just an onlooker in this new world but a key partaker and serious player, starting from 2019. We mean business” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
