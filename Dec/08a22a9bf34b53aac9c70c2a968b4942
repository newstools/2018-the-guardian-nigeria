The Red Devils are currently sixth on the log, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Manchester United released a statement on Tuesday morning that said: “Manchester United announces that manager Jose Mourinho has left the club with immediate effect. The club would like to thank Jose for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future. A new caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the current season, while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager.” Mourinho, who joined United in May 2016 has had a fractious relationship with some of his players including Paul Pogba, that was stripped of vice-captaincy. The former Chelsea manager has also polarised fans with the poor performances and defensive displays during games. Mourinho won the Europa League and League Cup in the 2016-17 season. He also got to the FA Cup final before finishing second in the Premier League last season. Michael Carrick will be appointed as the temporary manager in place of the Portuguese.
