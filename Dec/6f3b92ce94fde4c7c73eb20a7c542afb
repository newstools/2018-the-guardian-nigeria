The acquisition and merger of banks is no strange news. The news broke that Access bank merged with Diamond bank to the surprise of some Nigerians who didn’t see it coming. The merger of banks always causes discomfort as people are afraid of what will happen to their funds after as Nigerians have witnessed the ugly aftermath of bank distress which suddenly strips people of their savings. The diamond bank has always seemed like a “strong” bank who many are of the opinion will rather acquire than be acquired. While Access bank seemed like one of the financial institutions that people dismiss as a struggling institution. They have recently proven that they are secret achievers through the merger. Twitter is agog with hilarious comments to express reactions to the merger. Access Bank has been underrated all this while… If you remembered vividly, it was Access Bank that acquired the then almighty Intercontinental Bank. Now,they acquired solid looking Diamond Bank.
