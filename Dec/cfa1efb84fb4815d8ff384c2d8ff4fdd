The flight, which was scheduled to depart Lagos by 18:50pm, was delayed till 8:00pm when it eventually left for Port Harcourt. The passengers explained that though throughout the flight, there was no sign of the impending mechanical malfunction; people however became agitated after the pilot announced that the plane was set to land and yet could not for over 45 minutes. The flight eventually landed Port Harcourt airport at 10:00pm.
