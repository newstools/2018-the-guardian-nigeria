Top ranked Nigerian squash players cruised to victories in their respective games at the on-going OTrafford PSA National Closed Satellite Tournament at the 82 Division of the Army Officers Mess, Marina, Lagos. Nigeria’s women’s number one, Yemisi Olatunji, sailed to the semi-finals after beating Omolola Ajayi to setup a tussle with Taiwo Ebifemi in what is expected to be a sporadic showdown in the semi-finals of the tournament today. Olatunji, fresh from the just concluded National Sports Festival in Abuja, where she won gold for Lagos State, is confident of booking a place in the final as she aims to clinch the $500 prize money at stake. “This tournament is indeed another opportunity for me to prove my mettle in the game of squash,” she said. Her opponent, Ebifemi, who sustained an injury in a 9-11, 11-5, 11-2, 1-6 strenuous quarterfinal contest against Udeme James, also looks forward to the cracker against Olatunji, hoping to make a point by stunning bookmakers with a remarkable upset. In the male category, two work over were recorded, as highly rated Adewale Amao was worked over by sensational Lanre Pratt, while Del Pratt also worked over his opponent, Victor Daniel. It was, also a victorious day for fourth-seeded Sodiq Taiwo, who registered a 13-11, 13-11 straight sets against a resilient Nasir Abdulrahman to reach the quarterfinals. The semifinals of the tournament will hold on the squash courts of the OTrafford Squash Club today, as the four-day tournament approaches its grand finale tomorrow.
