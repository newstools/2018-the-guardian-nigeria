It has been learnt that Nicki Minaj has joined the cast of “Angry Birds 2” in an unspecified role. It is further gathered that the film will be directed by Thurop Van Orman and co-directed by John Rice. With an August 16, 2019 cinema premiere expected date, Minaj will be acting alongside Jason Sudeikis, Bill Hader, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage and Danny McBride, who will all reprise their roles from the first movie. They’ll also be joined by Leslie Jones, Rachel Bloom, Awkwafina, Sterling K. Brown, Eugenio Derbez, Lil Rel Howery, Dove Cameron and Zach Woods. This is not Minaj’s first time in a film as she has previously featured in “Ice Age: Continental Drift”, “Barbershop: The Next Cut” and The Other Woman. The release date for “Angry Birds Movie 2” coincides with the 10th anniversary of the hit video game. The “Angry Birds” games have been downloaded more than four billion times. “Angry Birds” grossed over N127 billion ($350 million) worldwide, including N39 million ($107.5 million) domestically, in 2016. The film, directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis, was set on an island populated entirely by happy, flightless birds — except for Red (voiced by Sudeikis), speedy Chuck (Gad), and Bomb (McBride). Hader returns as Leonard, king of the pigs, and Dinklage voices the Mighty Eagle.
