Represented by a board member Temitope Onaeko, the minister said “there so many vacant houses across major city of Nigeria, but we have not being putting all this factors into the computation of housing shortage in the country, we just give figures, like 17million housing deficit without considering all the vacant houses.”
 
He tasked the board to embark on data collection across the country so as to be able to ascertain the actual figure of housing deficit in the country, so as to aid planning. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
