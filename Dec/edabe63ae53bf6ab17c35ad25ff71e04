Multi-faceted afropop star Dotman releases the video for  ‘Owo’, a new single he hopes will inspire people to stick to their hustle. Produced by Wolfgang, Dj Memphis, and Yin Yang, ‘Owo’ is a straightforward song with a steady mid-tempo beat, telling a story many can relate to. We connect to the artiste’s plight and also feel encouraged to keep pushing.
