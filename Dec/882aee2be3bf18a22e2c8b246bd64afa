Omotola disclosed that the World Bank had predicted that if urgent steps were not taken, that by 2021, Nigeria would overtake India as the world capital for the death of children below five years.Stressing that the death of any child in the country is a national disaster, the nutrition expert said 50 per cent of children in 12 states are currently stunted as a result of malnutrition. Omotola likened child malnutrition to sentencing the victims to death for no crime. Arguing that one in five children with severe acute malnutrition cases would die, if treatment were not provided at the right time, he warned that children with acute malnutrition have nine-fold risk of death, compared with well-nourished children. UNICEF communication specialists Geoffrey Njoku and Samuel Kaalu, supported that media dialogue was necessary to expose the malnutrition status in the country.
