Truckers and tanker drivers may down tools and stage a protest at the Mile 2 end of Oshodi-Apapa Expressway Friday after a stray bullet hit and killed a driver on Thursday. The driver, identified as Hassan, was hit by a stray bullet shot by one of the policemen who went to raid the hideouts of suspected drug dealers and addicts around the Mile 2 bridge. “Heavily armed police officers on raids of drug dealers and addicts under the Mile2 bridge reportedly shot one of them but a stray bullet hit the driver tanker who died instantly,” the source told The Guardian. The protest is expected to compound the already chaotic traffic situation in the area caused by bad roads, indiscriminate parking by truckers and tanker drivers and lack of adequate parking spaces for the trucks heading to and from the port.
