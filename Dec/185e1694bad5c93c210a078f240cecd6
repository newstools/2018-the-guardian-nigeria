 Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti  The state commissioner for the Environment, Mr. Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti gave the charge at stakeholders’ meeting with the Victoria Island and Ikoyi resident Association (VIIRA) in Victoria Island.The Commissioner, who frowned at the alarming rate at which the highbrow areas were being defaced, said the ugly development was illegal and capable of causing grave danger to the community.He urged Victoria Island and Ikoyi residents to prioritize clean environment by being observant and protective of their immediate environment. Durosinmi- Etti called for strict adherence to Lagos State laws regarding waste management, noise pollution and approved master plan of government for the area.The Commissioner, who affirmed the commitment of the government to attain a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, frowned at the ugly development whereby some residents continued to patronize cart pushers and dump indiscriminately on the roads, in spite several warnings on the environmental and health implications of such acts. Durosinmi-Etti emphasised that the State Government had repeatedly warned against any abuse of its laws and all acts capable of compounding the challenge of waste management in the state.He also observed with dismay the proliferation of religious worship centres and Nite clubs in various residential areas in the Victoria Island and Ikoyi metropolis, and called for caution on the noise level to avoid rancor in the society. His words: “any noise above the approved noise levels contravened the provisions of the National Environmental Noise Standard and Controls regulations 2009 as well as the Lagos State Environmental Laws 2017”.He sought the cooperation of religious centres and club owners for the maintenance of the acceptable noise levels for residential areas, which is 55 decibels during the day and 45 decibels at night, saying that they were expected to operate in an enclosed and soundproof environment with regulated use of speakers. According to him, the state government would not rest on its oars in ensuring that Lagosians inculcate the habit of regular maintenance of their immediate environment. In his remarks, the Vice Chairman of VIIRA, Dr. Salami thanked the Lagos State Government for its support in ensuring that the Victoria Island and Ikoyi Environment remained cleaner, healthier and safer.He pledged that his association would spur members of his community to cooperate with the government to stop all acts capable of degrading the environment.
