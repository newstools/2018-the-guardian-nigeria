Nigerian Police on Monday said that having sex in a car at a public place is not a crime and would not amount to arrest if done by persons within adult age in the country. Police spokesman Abayomi Shogunle made the disclosure while responding to a question by a Nigerian Twitter user. The Twitter user @Stanley_Moses13 asked, “Oga Yomi Shogunle please is it a crime to have sex in your car?” Shogunle said it is not an offence provided the location is not a place of worship and the persons involved are of opposite sex that is 18 years or older. Currently, Nigerian law prohibits the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, ally, pansexual) community. “Sex in a car in a public place is not a crime in Nigeria provided; location is not a place of worship; parties are 18 yrs+; the act is consensual (agreed to by parties) [and] parties are of opposite sex,” Shogunle said. He insisted that persons who conform to the rules he mentioned cannot be arrested by the police. He said if such persons are threatened with an arrest, they should lodge a complaint with the  Public Complaint Rapid Response Unit of the Nigerian police.
