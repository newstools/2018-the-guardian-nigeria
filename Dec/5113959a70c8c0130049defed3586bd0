Former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Adamu Mauzu Wednesday met for about two hours in a closed-door with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the presidential villa, Abuja. Mauzu left the villa at 4:35 pm. He did not speak to newsmen. After departure, speculation was rife that the former PDP national chairman was allegedly being wooed by the President Mohammadu Buhari-led ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of 2019 general elections. However, it was gathered that the former PDP Chairman was in the villa to thank Vice President Osinbajo who at the weekend attended his daughterâ€™s (Muazu) wedding in Bauchi. The wedding was also attended by former Vice President and the PDP Presidential standard bearer in the 2019 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, traditional rulers, political and business associates of the former PDP chairman among other important personalities from across the country.
