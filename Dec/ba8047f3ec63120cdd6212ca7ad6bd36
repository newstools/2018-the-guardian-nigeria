The Oyo State government yesterday shut Community Grammar School, Olodo with immediate effect. The government, in a statement by the Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Mrs. Ibironke Fatoki, said the school was shut over the incident of arson that occurred in its premises on Friday during a mob action by some hoodlums after a violent protest by junior secondary school students the day before. Fatoki stated that the government has set up a six-man administrative investigative panel to examine the immediate and remote causes of the incident, adding that the panel is expected to submit its report in seven working days. She disclosed that a block of three classrooms and four cars were burnt during the protest, with a life also lost during the two days of mayhem. Meanwhile, the Ekiti State government on Monday summoned the Principal of Ado Grammar School, Ado Ekiti, Ebenezer Falayi, over report of alleged collection of unauthorized fees and other levies. The deputy governor, Bisi Egbeyemi, who summoned the principal to his office, said he has been receiving complaints that some school heads were still defying the Executive Order prohibiting collection of illegal fees from pupils of public schools. The deputy governor, however, pardoned the principal on compassionate grounds as he is due to retire from service at the end of the current academic session. Egbeyemi revealed that he received complaints from two parents that the principal was alleged to have been collecting a sum of N6,900 from each students for school uniforms, socks, school barge, cardigan, sports vest, hymn book, prospectus, file jackets and examination fee.
