 Borno State  Commissioner of Police, Mr Damian Chukwu  Chukwu warned that thuggery, intimidation and violent demonstrations would not be condoned before, during and after elections.
Making the point at the weekend in Maiduguri to Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) members, he advised politicians to conduct themselves and promote peace and tranquility in the state. He disclosed that the use of indecent, intemperate, slanderous or base languages or insinuations to provoke violent reactions is an offence under the 2010 Amended Electoral Act. According to him, campaigns based on religion or ethnicity should be avoided to prevent political incitements and intimidation.
“Your political campaigns should be devoid of abusive languages directly or indirectly intended to injure religious and ethnic feelings,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
