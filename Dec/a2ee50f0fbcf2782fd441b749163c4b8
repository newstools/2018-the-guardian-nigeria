According to him, “the project entails among other things, nine clovers – four at Kofar Mata junction, four at Ado Bayero road (Singer)/Ibrahim Taiwo road and one at Kofar Mata by Sani Abacha stadium.” He added that “as you are aware, flyovers have become a vital part of mega cities like Kano, as a result of rapid urban development. “Kano is an emerging mega city which implies that you have to constantly upgrade and provide new infrastructure like roads, flyovers and underpasses to meet the demands of the teeming population.” He pointed out that with the new flyover, commuters would find movement into the old Kano City faster with reduced travel times and leading to less carbon emissions from exhaust fumes in hold-ups along the busy roads. “We are going to witness an innovative project that will add value to the landscape of the state capital. It will be completed within a time frame of 24 months”, the commissioner said. On his part, Mr Lin Zhengliang, who signed on behalf of the TEC Engineering Company, promised to complete the project within the stipulated time and according to the agreed specifications.
