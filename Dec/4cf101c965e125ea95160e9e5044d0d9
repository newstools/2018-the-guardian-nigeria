Nigerian senator senator Shehu Sani on Sunday said that crises between local farmers and herdsmen in Kaduna State were yet to be resolved. Earlier this year, some residents of the state had to flee their homes due to local farmers and herdsmen crisis, which the government claimed have been resolved. “There is herder crisis in Kaduna;there are killings and kidnappings,” Sani said in a tweet on Sunday. “Visit Birnin Gwari and parts of southern Kaduna, listen to the orphans, the widows and the families of the victims.” Prior to Sani’s alert, Kaduna residents had observed 24-hour curfew on two occasions in October due to religious crises. But Sani, who is representing Kaduna Central at the Nigerian Senate, said the government’s claim of achieving peace between both parties was far from the truth. He accused the state governor Nasir El-Rufai, with whom he has a running battle, which culminated in his defection to the People’s Redemption Party (PRP), of lying to burnish his image. “Don’t listen to a politician giving you false information and impression to embellish his stewardship,” he said. The state government had not responded to Sani’s claims as at the time of this report. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
