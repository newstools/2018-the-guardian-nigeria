 President Muhammadu Buhari  I supported Buhari in 2015 with all my heart and powers of intellectual influence. But since 2015, I’ve not earned a full salary. Yet, his anti corruption drive is an efficacious cure for Nigeria’s most debilitating problem of waste and looting of state resources. But the anti- corruption war must be fought with honesty and objectivity, not targeted at political opponents only. Then, we talk of another serious challenge to our peace and corporate existence – insecurity! I wish to dwell on this subject more pointedly. President Buhari’s government has been mostly flawed by the spate of killings in Nigeria through various insurgent groups. The killings and kidnaps of people in Nigeria constitute a lot of blight on this administration. It is not as if this government created the problem. There has been the mother of all kidnaps of the Chibok girls under the Goodluck Jonathan-led government of the PDP. That government failed us on the grounds of insecurity and corruption accentuated by the unspeakable carnage of looting of government treasury. But that was why the PDP government  was voted out while the expectedly messianic APC was voted into power to arrest the surge of insecurity and corruption in Nigeria.  Yet, up till now, the presidency is not talking about the Vigilante Bill. Nigerians have been asking to know why the president has been silent or slow to speak about that bill. Just why has President Buhari not signed that bill into law despite the desperate security challenges in the country? The issue of state or community police has been widely discussed, debated and agreed to by a wide spectrum of Nigerians. But up till now, nothing concrete is being said about it by this administration.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
