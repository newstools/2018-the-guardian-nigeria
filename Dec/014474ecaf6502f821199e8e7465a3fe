I am excited to announce that I have been elected director of International Academy of Television, Arts & Sciences, the organization responsible for staging the world famous International Emmy Awards. I am pleased about this appointment because it will be an enabler for the recognition of our work in TV and film across the globe. And I mean “Our” as in our work from Nigeria.  As a member of the board, I join a select group of about 100 Directors who are international executives from leading channels, production and distribution companies. I am expected to attend board & members meetings 3 or 4 times a year. It’s time to change the narrative and get our stories told! #AwesomeGod A post shared by  Mo Abudu (@moabudu) on Dec 21, 2018 at 1:23am PST In October 2018, Mo Abudu was added to the 2018 UK ‘100 Black Powerlist.
