Billionaiere media mogul, Oprah Winfrey is making one thing clear and that is that she has no plans of hosting the 2019 Oscar Awards. TMZ caught up with her an last Friday night, December 14 inÂ New York City. She was entering the Whitby Hotel and the media outlet asked if she would be open to hosting the Oscars if the Academy asked her. She had an unequivocal answer as she replied in the negative but the way she delivers it is even more telling. This is coming after reports that the Academy has been finding it hard to find a host following the Kevin Hart debacle. It would be recalled that Hart had to step down as host of the event after taking heat for his homophobic comments years ago, and the Academy is also taking a beating for demanding an apology from Hart when criticisms as his choice for host started pouring in.
