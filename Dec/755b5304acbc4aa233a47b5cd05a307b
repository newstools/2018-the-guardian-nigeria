The Lagos State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress Saturday said there was no iota of truth in the allegation that its members were responsible for the pulling down the campaign materials belonging to the People’s Democratic Party in the state. Lagos APC spokesperson Joe Igbokwe in a statement said the party did not instruct anybody to “thrash whatever that is remaining of PDP in Lagos.” Few hours after campaigns for Governorship and State Assembly elections across Nigeria officially commenced according to the Independent National Electoral Commission’s timetable, the Lagos PDP governorship candidate Jimi Agbeje said some people had vandalized and removed the party’s publicity boards. Agbaje said, “some of our deployment staff were also threatened with violence and warned to desist.” Igbokwe, however, said APC members will not “engage in acts of brigandage and political recklessness.” He alleged that “miserable PDP followers can deliberately pull down their posters and push it to APC.” Igbokwe also appealed to the APC members not to tamper with PDP campaign materials in the name of helping the party. “You have no right to do so and you cannot do so. We do not need such help from anybody. It is undemocratic, primitive, illegal and unacceptable. Please do not bring shame to our great Party,” he said.
