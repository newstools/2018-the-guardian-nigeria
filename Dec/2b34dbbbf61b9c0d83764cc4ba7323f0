“We understand there are students who are not so interested in academics, as much as we push them to read, we also expose them to sports, technology, agriculture, public speaking, community services and other opportunities around the globe so as to gain skills and qualifications to compete with, and most importantly work with the best.” Best graduating student, Fadare Oluwamvrewa, said she has been given great skills in agriculture, art and technology to develop what her teachers taught in class. “We are encouraged to even engage in humanitarian services like taking care of children in orphanage homes and so on.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
