According to the minister, the carnival, Ntim Otarok Cultural Carnival, is a “demonstration of bravery and show of strength.” It is an annual celebration aimed at bringing peace, unity and development to Tarok land and Nigeria at large. Although this is not the first time Dalung will dress in traditional Tarok outfit, the recent one has elicited mixed reactions from the public.   A post shared by Solomon Dalung (@solomondalung) on Dec 19, 2017 at 8:02am PST  An assistant professor of journalism and columnist with National Tribune newspaper Farooq Kperogi decried Dalung’s dressing. “He goes to the marketplace half-clad and then clowns around in the name of “culture,” Kperogi said. Otunba Ajibola, a Twitter user in reaction to the outfit said, “Firstly, I think culture and morality go hand in hand. I mean, an ideal culture promotes morality.” “Any culture that encourages public display of Indecency should be scrapped. Common, this man is almost naked in this attire. “We are in the 21st century for crying out loud.” Eric Afam, however, tweeted that “morality is considered a personal choice, different religion and cultures follow their founder ideology. To his tribe, the lion skin clothes signify pride and glory of his people and ancestors. What is moral to you might be immoral to another person Oluwakayode tweeted “Haba… He’s reconnecting with his cultural roots. What’s all the fuss about??” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
