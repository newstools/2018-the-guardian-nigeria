•AD candidate steps down for Peoples Trust’s Olawepo-Hashim
Standard-bearer of the All Grassroots Alliance (AGA), Mr. Chuks Nwachuku, has sued the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), seeking the disqualification of President Muhammadu Buhari. The candidate, who is seeking the declaration at a Federal High Court in Abuja, prayed that Buhari be disqualified from seeking re-election for failing to produce his authentic certificate. Nwachuku, who is suing on behalf of himself and other class of Nigerians interested in credible elections in 2019, filed the suit last Friday. He said INEC was not legally competent to recognise Buhari as the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in next year’s general elections, having failed produce the credentials to which he lays claim. The plaintiff, who is also a lawyer, said it was rather ironic that Buhari only submitted an affidavit claiming that his certificate was with the Nigerian Army to which he is the Grand Commander. He added that the same institution had publicly debunked such claim of being in possession of the academic credentials belonging to the president. The matter is yet to be assigned to a judge, while no date has been fixed for hearing. Meanwhile, presidential candidate of the Alliance for Democracy (AD), Eniola Ojajuni, has stepped down from the race to support the standard-bearer of the Peoples’ Trust, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim. Announcing his decision in a statement at the weekend, he called for the criminalisation of vote buying to stop the trend in the country’s political system. He urged that efforts be made to vote out old, desperate and recycled politicians, who when it became impossible to snatch ballot boxes, resort to buying votes. Ojajuni said his decision to step down and support the PT’s candidate was based on his doggedness; intelligence and capabilities to champion the cause for a new Nigeria. He implored Nigerians to look beyond individual interests, as the country is in need of men and women who are ready to sacrifice their personal ambition. The former AD candidate admitted that stepping down was a difficult decision to make, but for his love and patriotism for Nigeria. He appreciated all youths who have been supportive of his candidacy, from the beginning of the race to the present moment. Olawepo-Hashim, who expressed delight over the development, welcomed the declaration and prayed for a harmonious working relationship with Ojajuni towards credible leadership in 2019. He disclosed that discussions were ongoing with other political parties nationwide, which would lead to the collapse of their political structures into Peoples Trust campaign.
