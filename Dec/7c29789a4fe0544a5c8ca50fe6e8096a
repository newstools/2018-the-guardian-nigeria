Lawmakers have also summoned Sports Minister Solomon Dalung, top AFN officials and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The minister of youths and sports, Solomon Dalung, has denounced the late release of funds that would be used in hosting the National Sports Festival 2018 fixed to hold in Abuja. Dalung disclosed this during the National Sports Festival’s ‘Pre Scientific Congress’ in Abuja. The minister claims the ministry has been able to function despite the usually deprived budgetary allocation to the ministry. “All these huge successes were recorded with paltry allocation and all I said is [it is] injustice. Nigeria must look round investing in sports because it’s doing very well,” Dalung said. “We are planning and hosting the national sports festival in 9 months instead of 2 years. You should expect some of the challenges we are facing,” he added. “We must always struggle, follow and sometimes reach the office of the president before we get funds released to us,” the minister said. “The government must change the attitude of releasing money at the dying minute.” Dalung complained about the government’s outlook of sport before he stated the importance of sports. “We have not come to appreciate sports as a major factor of national development. We still see sports as recreation. Sports create wealth, promotes peace and unity,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
