Lagos State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources Olawale Oluwo has resigned his appointment and has left the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). “A few hours ago, I submitted to His Excellency, the Governor of Lagos State, a letter of resignation of my appointment as Honourable Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources. And consequently as a registered member of the All Progressives Congress,” Oluwo said in his resignation letter. Oluwo accused APC of deliberately overseeing an “integrity-deficient” governorship primary” in October. The primaries saw the incumbent governor Akinwunmi Ambode losing to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who enjoyed the support of the dominant power blocs in the party. Oluwo is expected to defect to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). He claimed that the party lacked integrity, stressing that this has diminished the reputation of the state as a reference point for free and fair democratic practice. Oluwo said, “My decision to resign is not unconnected with the recent events of the last few weeks, which have encouraged a moral burden for me. I have found it rather difficult to come to terms and rationalize the party’s conduct of the October 2018 primary elections,” “Which were largely characterized by massive voter disenfranchisement, intimidation, violence, undue influence and non-compliance with all known principles of democracy.” “The integrity-deficient nature of the primary has significantly diminished the hard-earned reputation of our State as a reference point for a free and fair democratic practice,” Oluwo said. The APC leadership in the state has yet to respond to Oluwo’s allegations. Oluwo and the state governor Akinwunmi Ambode hail from Epe division of Lagos. Ambode lost his return ticket after losing out of APC governorship primary election in September to Babajide Sanwo-Olu.
