And for the first time at The Experience is JJ Hairston, Planetshakers and Ada Ehi. Averaging a yearly attendance of over 500,000 people at the venue, with millions more watching online from all over the globe, it has grown to become one of the biggest gospel concerts in the world. The Experience started in 2OO6 as a thought inspired by God Metropolitan Senior Pastor of all House on The Rock churches, Pastor Paul Adefarasin said. Adefarasin, at a press conference on Friday, explained that the inspiration behind the 2018 theme is to highlight who Jesus is, especially in the world we live in today – the Prince of Peace. In its 13th edition, with the theme, ‘Jesus our Peace’, the allure of The experience is its penchant for unifying people irrespective of nationality, faith, gender, status or political persuasion. He said the event is held every year at the Tafawa Balewa Square in Largo because of the spiritual, historical and political significance of the TBS as a true iconic centre of hope for a people determined to establish their true identity. According to him, The Experience 2O18 promises to be an evening of edifying enjoyment as the constellation of the world’s finest gospel artistes would be leading us in unrestrained praise and worship into our Creator’s glorious presence. He noted that regardless of the outcome of the forthcoming elections; peace is the ultimate candidate that we should all support, and must be the candidate that wins. “Despite many challenges  Nigerians may face, we cannot afford to lose faith in God’s ability to turn things around for our good, choosing to see a bright future, the Nigeria of our dreams, one that we can proudly bequeath to the next generation.” “Our elected representatives can no longer afford to the selfish luxury of focusing on their own interests, rather they must be fully capable of managing our affairs.” “The population can no longer sit back and complain of lack of clear direction. It is time to become change agents, nation transformers and the solution that Nigeria has long awaited. Providentially, the Nigerian electorate is fast evolving from nonchalant, passive onlookers into politically keen, invested and active participants seeking to develop and enshrine good governance, as evidenced by the number of technocrats vying for elective positions in the forthcoming general elections” Adefarasin said each Nigerian registered to vote must do so with a clear conscience devoid of prejudice or self-interest. “Our vote must be for peace, transparency, credibility, equity, justice, inclusion, development and unity. Patriotism should be of necessity, be our motivation and above all, peace must be our ultimate candidate regardless of the outcome of the elections. We all need to work together for a peaceful win.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
