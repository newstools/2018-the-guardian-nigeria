Commercial revenue was up £32 million, helped by a new Nike kit deal worth a reported £60 million a year, while matchday revenues also increased by £8.4 million. “The club has now posted a series of record-breaking revenue figures and our profit margin has increased in consecutive years,” said chairman Bruce Buck in a statement. “This has occurred against a backdrop of varying participation in European football, and different degrees of achievement in the Premier League, which demonstrates we have built a sound business footing to support our on-pitch quest for success.” The latest figures for the season ending June 30, 2018 include the sales of Diego Costa to Atletico Madrid, Nemanja Matic to Manchester United, Nathan Ake to Bournemouth and the permanent transfer of Juan Cuadrado to Juventus. However, the accounts do not include the severance pay for Antonio Conte or his coaching staff. Conte was sacked in July after the Blues’ finished fifth and failed to qualify for this season’s Champions League.
