President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to give space for consultation with the organised labour over the new minimum wage crisis. He said the President should not only hear from one side of his appointees but should also hear from the unions and workers. The NLC president, who spoke yesterday during a surprised reception organised for him by the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU)  in Abuja, said the organised labour had bargained so hard, yet got very little, insisting that there is no going back to the N35,000 minimum wage. He  vowed to take the minimum wage struggle to the next level, saying: “Initially, we were struggling alone, but now, we have 163 countries that we can send instructions to and they will extend solidarity to Nigerian workers. “It is also high time for our politicians, looters and elite to realise that once they loot our resources, and with us liaising with our airport workers, they should be sure that we will mobilise the people there to turn them back when they want to leave the airport to the next destination. They must stay here and fix our economy and make Nigeria work,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
