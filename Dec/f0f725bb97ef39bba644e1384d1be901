Festus Keyamo The Director of Media of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, Festus Keyamo, has said the opposition People’s Democratic Party of running a self-indicting campaign. Keyamo’s comment is coming barely 24 hours after PDP kicked off its 2019 presidential campaign in Sokoto State. The director, media and publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the campaign would address the concerns, plights, fears and aspirations of Nigerians in the geopolitical zone, in line with the policy document of the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. In his opinion, Keyamo said the campaign is the “most self-indicting campaign I have ever seen”. He said the PDP campaign has been focused on the ills the party created for the country during its 16-year rule. “They use the same problem they caused as a basis for their campaign, the issues regarding the economy upon which they have centred their campaign, the issue regarding the division of the country around which they have also centred their campaign”. Keyamo said the PDP “have been deceiving Nigerians that the whole of the problems, the economic problems and all started under Buhari.” During his campaign on Monday Atiku described President Muhammadu Buhari as incompetent in handling the country’s affairs. The former vice-president, who said if given the opportunity, he would turn around the fortune of the country, said he has what it takes to move Nigeria forward.
