Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai has declared that he won’t wait for results to be announced before conceding defeat, if he loses the upcoming election. The governor, who said he has better things to attend to, disclosed this yesterday at a Summit Towards Peaceful 2019 General Election in Kaduna, organised by the Kaduna State Peace Commission (KAPECOM) in the state. He warned politicians and their followers to desist from engaging in hate speech, falsehood and ethnic sentiments in the social media, capable of breaching peace in the state. He urged campaigns in the upcoming elections to be based on ‘issues and achievements.’ According to him: “It was the massive rigging of elections in 2011 that led to widespread violence at that time and Kaduna State lost over 800 lives.” He added that election of 2015 was a game changer, because everybody believed that it was credible particularly in the northern part of the state. He said to a large extent, most people believed that the 2015 elections were credible; hence it was inevitable that ex-president Goodluck Jonathan had to concede defeat. Here in Kaduna, he said, we are also happy that the governor then called me to accepted defeat. “We just returned from Osun State for the inauguration of a governor. I was there for the first round of election and it was the most credible election I have ever seen in the world,” he said. He stressed that election materials arrived early, and there was no incidents of destruction, violence or snatching of ballot boxes. El-Rufai added that as a candidate of APC, if INEC conducts the 2019 election with the same kind of credibility as Osun, there would be no violence at all, because it is rigging that leads to violence.
