Cross River State that failed to stage the 19th National Sports Festival that caused it to suffer several postponements, has joined in the bid to host the next edition. The Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung confirmed this yesterday while fielding questions at the main bowl of the Abuja National Stadium. Dalung, however, explained that aside paucity of funds that affected Cross River state from performing the civic responsibility, sudden change of guard hugely contributed to the state’s inability to host the festival. He said that the host of the 2010 edition of the sports festival would be properly scrutinised to avoid postponements. Though, Dalung did not disclose names of other state in the race, he said he was still expecting more states to express interest. The Sports Minister said entertainment would be included in subsequent editions of the sports festival. On the suggestion to domicile the Festival in Abuja to ensure optimal utilisation of the facilities at the Abuja National Stadium, Dalung said such would defeat the purpose for which the National Sports Festival was introduced.
