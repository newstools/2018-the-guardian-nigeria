Immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose on Wednesday afternoon sustained injuries after his G-Wagon Benz with registration number AAA777TM was involved in multiple car crash. The accident occurred on Third Mainland Bridge inward Iyana Oworo at about 1:00p.m. It was gathered that Fayose had driven the white G-Wagon, which rammed into a broken down commercial bus and a patrol motorcycle parked beside it. The accident, it was gathered, also affected a Toyota Avalon with registration number FKJ643DR. Although no life was lost, The Guardian learnt that shattered glasses penetrated Fayose’s body. The former governor was administered first aid by the Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS) at the scene of the incident while all the vehicles were evacuated from the scene. The media aide of the former governor, Lere Olayinka, revealed that Fayose was in a stable condition and receiving medical treatment. He tweeted: “Fayose was involved in auto accident on Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos. He is in stable condition as I write while he is receiving medical attention.” It would be recalled that on October 25, 2017, Fayose’s white Mercedes Benz G-Wagon caught fire on Oshodi bridge in Lagos, while in motion. The SUV, said to be worth N44 million caught fire while being driven to the airport though Fayose was not in the vehicle in last year’s incident. Olayinka had said then: “Though he was meant to be in the vehicle, by providence, he was not there. What caused the sudden fire under the vehicle is yet to be ascertained. The governor is grateful to God that no casualty was recorded. He also thanked the people who made spirited efforts to put out the fire.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
