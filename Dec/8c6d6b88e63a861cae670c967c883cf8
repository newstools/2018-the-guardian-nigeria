According to eyewitnesses at the Five Star Bus Stop near Aswani Market, Isolo, where the incident occurred, said the passenger was stabbed by the conductor over a disagreement on N100 balance. According to eyewitnesses, the bus was heading to Aswani market area; the passenger opted to alight at the junction before the market and demanded his N100 change. The Guardian gathered that the conductor refused to hand over the change and allegedly threatened the passenger. As the argument got heated, the conductor took a knife from the wares of a Hausa man selling hardware by the roadside and stabbed the passenger, who died immediately. Passer-bys immediately attacked the conductor in return and set him ablaze. They also burnt the vehicle. The driver of the bus flew the scene. Trouble doubled along the road after the same passenger-sympathizers took possession of the left side of the road to wreak more havoc on commercial buses. The Guardian gathered that three other danfo vehicles were destroyed in retaliation of the passengerâ€™s death. The death of the two set the environment unsettled the area as traders, motorists and pedestrians scampered for their lives and commercial activities halted temporarily.
