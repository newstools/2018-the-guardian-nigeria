REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde/File Photo Stop ranting; pay workers salary with N30b from FG, ex-gov tells successor
Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi and the immediate past governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, yesterday traded words over the financial status of the state as the duo engaged each other in accusation and counter-accusation. Fayemi, who threw the first salvo at the monthly ‘Meet your Governor’ programme aired in the state on Sunday, accused his predecessor of plundering the N18 billion Paris Club refund to the state during his tenure. But reacting to the allegation, Fayose asked the state governor to use the alleged over N30 billion his government already received from the Federal Government as refund on federal roads construction, arrears of budget support and Paris Club refund to pay workers’ salary instead of jumping up and down lying against his predecessor. Fayemi had, while featuring on the December edition of the programme, expressed worries over how Fayose, who allegedly owed between four and eight months salary and pension arrears could not defray the backlog of workers’ benefit with such humongous amount of money but rather preferred to divert the money for other use. “Governor Fayose had the opportunity of paying bulk of these backlog of salaries and pensions. He collected N18 billion out of the N21.5 billion due to Ekiti State in the fund. Media aide to Fayose, Mr. Lere Olayinka, who reacted to the allegation that his boss plundered the N18 billion Paris Club refund to the state, said that Fayemi was making weak attempt at deceiving the people as usual.
