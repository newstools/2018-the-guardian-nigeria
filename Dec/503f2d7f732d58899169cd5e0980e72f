He added that the Tour president, Emeka Okata was the architect of the success story. Okata had stated that the West African Golf Tour was founded in 2016 with the primary purpose of promoting and developing the game of golf in Africa, and providing current and future talents opportunities to build their careers as professional golfers and compete internationally. “Since it was launched in February 2016, the Tour has staged 23 tournaments gathering players from eleven different countries, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Germany, Ghana and Nigeria. Other countries include Senegal, South Africa, Spain, Zambia and Zimbabwe. “This unique and pioneer Tour in Africa will go a step further in 2019 and usher in the African Tour, so all players from the continent will identify with the Tour irrespective of the country they come from. At the same time, it will continue to attract players from all over the world,” Emeka Okata said. He added that the African Tour would give women the opportunity to play all tournaments alongside with men and compete for the same trophy after successfully passing the qualifying school.
