Today marks the eight-year memorial anniversary of the death of Nigeria’s foremost Nationalist, Chief Anthony Eronsele Enahoro. Chief Enahoro was the man that first moved the Motion for Nigeria’s Independence in a motion titled: “Let My People Go.” He was the first Nigerian to agitate for “Restructuring” through his Movement for National Reformation (MNR) during Babangida’s Regime. Chief Enahoro as the Leader of National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) spearheaded the opposition force that led to the end of over 35 years of military rule in Nigeria. There are some unknown facts about this hero of Nigeria’s independence. Ironically, Chief Enahoro that fought for the Nigerian common masses all his life was born to royalty. His mother was Princess Enibokun Okojie from Uromi Royal House and his father was Prince Okotako Enahoro from Onewa Royal House. His maternal grandfather was HRH Ogbidi Okojie 1 King of Uromi who with Oba Overiamen of Benin fought the British Government to a standstill during the colonial era. He was born on July 22, 1923 and died on December 15, 2010. Chief Enahoro was the first Nigerian member of Ikoyi Club. Chief Enahoro was the First Nigerian Golfer. Chief Enahoro was the youngest ever Editor of any major newspaper (at age 21) in the world. He was jailed three times by the British Government for sedition in 1946, 1947 and 1947. Chief Enahoro, as Minister for Information Western Region, built the first TV Station in Africa. He was in charge of building the National Theater Iganmu (as President of FESTAC) and the National Stadium Surulere, as federal Commissioner in charge of Sports. A journalist of repute and astute politician, he served in different capacities in the newspapers that he worked with and also served meritoriously in public service. Even though you departed this world eight years ago, you remain fresh in our memories as a loving Dad, Grandpa and a most formidable fighter for democracy. We remember you with very fond memories and hope that you can occasionally steal a peak down here to see how your legacy is shinning on in the family. We cannot say the same for the country you gave so much of your youth for, but suffice it to say that those informed on the true history of Nigeria remember that you boldly made the motion for our independence from the British and thus started the ball rolling till Nigeria gained independence in 1960. You always fought for what you believed in, even if everyone else was afraid to speak up for fear of recriminations. You oftentimes jeopardized your own life in your quest to fight for the common man. This was a much admired quality; although we the family sometimes felt a little baffled and somewhat neglected that you gave so much focus to the ordinary man but we recognize your strength and courage. We do appreciate your instilling so much national pride in us and in Nigerians as a whole. The guys, as you fondly referred to your grandchildren, still recall the times they spent with you in Miami and Washington D.C. We miss your stories and mischievous sense of humour. Adieu dad and continue to rest in peace till we meet again.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
