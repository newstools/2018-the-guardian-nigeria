Johnnie, Jazz & Whisky (JJW) turned on the style last Saturday as musical songstress Asa and afrobeat maestro Femi Kuti held up the audience in a jaw scintillating fusion of music and flavours. The event began with cameras clicking away at the ‘black carpet’, as live instrumentals ushered guests into the cocktail area where mixologists delighted with a full array of whisky cocktails. Beginning with performances by Efezino, Yimika & Chike. The eureka moment came where award-winning Asa soon took the stage, performing her sweet melodies for 45 jaw-dropping minutes in a lead up to the high energy afro-magical performance of Mr Femi Kuti. Femi Kuti’s main act was full-on electrifying.
