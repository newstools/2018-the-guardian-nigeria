PHOTO: Twitter/BBC Sport Manchester United starlet, Shola Shoretire has made UEFA Youth League history by becoming the youngest player to play in the competition at 14 years and 314 days. Shoretire, eligible for Nigeria, was brought in as a substitute by Nicky Butt, the manager of Manchester United’s Under-19 team, in the UEFA Youth League game against Valencia. The talented teenager came on for the final 15 minutes of the clash to replace Nishan Burkart. Shoretire, who has trained with England youth sides, was part of United’s under-18s and under-23s’ training camp in Austria in pre-season. For the past two years, he has performed remarkably despite playing above his age group in the youth ranks. The talented teenager replaced the previous record holder Miles Svilar of Benfica as the youngest player to feature in the UEFA Youth League. Manchester United qualified as winners of Group H ahead of Juventus. Butt’s team won five and drew one of their fixtures.
