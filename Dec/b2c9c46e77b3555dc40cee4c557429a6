Nigerian singer, 2face Idibia has revealed that having many baby mamas at a young age, almost sent him into depression. According to the multiple award-winning entertainer who has seven children from three women, said having many children from different women made him drink a lot in the past as many people mcoked him.

It would be recalled that just last month, Annie and Pero settled their long standing feud and this act brought the singer to tears.
