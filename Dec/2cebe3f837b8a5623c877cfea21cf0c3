21-year-old Kylie Jenner has impressed on the mind of many that she is not the little girl that many first knew from her family’s hit reality show, “Keeping Up With The Kardashians”. Not only has she become a mother but she has also been able to build a successful business empire to make her a force to be reckoned and not just another reality TV star. The makeup mogul in a new ranking by Forbes has been named the fifth richest American celebrity with a net worth of N328,500,000,000 ($900 million). This net worth ties her with rapper and music business mogul Jay-Z. Jenner’s fortunes shifted to a major high when she launched her Kylie Cosmetics two years ago and it is reported by Forbes that it has already shifted over N229,950,000,000 ($630 million) in makeup products, according to Forbes. Jenner is a first-timer on the list, which ranks the wealthiest American celebrities based on fortune they have amassed off their fame. The number one spot on the list this year is held by George Lucas, whose net worth was listed at N1,971,000,000,000 ($5.4 billion). The second place spot goes to Steven Spielberg, who is valued at  N1,350,500,000,000 ($3.7 billion), while Oprah Winfrey landed in third with N1,022,000,000,000 ($2.8 billion). Michael Jordan’s net worth of N620,500,000,000 ($1.7 billion) placed him in fourth place. David Copperfield’s N319,375,000,000 ($875 million) landed him in seventh, Diddy’s  N301,125,000,000 ($825 million) saw him take the eighth spot. Tiger Woods and James Patterson tied for the ninth spot with a net worth of N292,000,000,000 ($800 million).
