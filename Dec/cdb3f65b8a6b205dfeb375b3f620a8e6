The Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the President of the Nigerian Universities Games Association (NUGA), Prof Stephen Hamalyfeto to host the 2019 edition of the Games. It was in fulfillment of the bid made by his predecessor, Prof Rahamon Bello while in office last year. As a follow up to host the 26th edition of NUGA tournament, and as part of preparation for the Games, the VC signed the MOU with NUGA President at the institution’s senate chambers, in preparation to make the sporting competition of undergraduate athletes from different institutions in Nigeria a memorable one. The VC said the institution contested the biding right with the University of Jos. “We believe in the ideals of NUGA and in the capacity of its sporting competitions to raise all-round graduates who are equipped for solid service to the nation and humanity. This is why we will put in all effort in our preparations as our Local Organising Committee (LOC), and its various sub-committees have been set up and their members are working diligently,” he said. He added that the sporting facilities had been upgraded to world-class standard, such that young athletes now have platform to showcase their talents unhindered. “We also had a competition to design NUGA mascot, slogan and theme, which is open to all our students for the forthcoming games in order to encourage their participation, and very soon, the best of all the entries will be selected and unveiled. It will be the third time UNILAG will be hosting NUGA Games.NUGA president said if Nigeria is going to grow sport; there was dire need to focus on the universities. “Our mandate is to harness and grow young athletes from the universities and hand them over to world university game. Under the VC’s office, the directorate of sport and programmes of universities provides for the best athletes from secondary schools, so if students are given very good sport activities in secondary schools, after graduating, the university should be the next net to trap them,” he said.
