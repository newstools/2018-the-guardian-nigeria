Sir: There is no meaningful development in almost every part of Benue State but the situation in Mbakyan community area of Kwande Local Government, where you came from appeared to be worst and most devastating. Mbakyan community is one of the abandoned places that lack the basic needs of life despite the contributions of its people in electing leaders and ensuring the upholding of peace and order for the smooth running of every administration in power. It is a thing of joy and hope to see you (Abanyi Sugh) emerged as a State Assembly candidate for Kwande west constituency under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It is surely an opportunity for Mbakyan people to support you and ensure your victory. The people of Inanev and Ishagev-Ya that constituted Kwande West would indeed vote you for demonstrating God fearing in everything you do. Your types are rare and if they seek for leadership positions should be given to enable them administer leadership that can touch the lives of the common ones in the society. Sir, the role you played long ago regarding a misunderstanding between the two different parts of Mbakyan Community on land issue, which was eventually resolved without bloodshed has demonstrated love, peace and unity in your character. I have known you as a devout Christian, a patriotic citizen and a man of his words. You hate injustice and you are God fearing.  I pray that you deviate not from what I have known you for and succeed in your political pursuit to help rescue your people from long suffering of neglect and refutation of democratic dividends.
