 Governor Udom Gabriel Emmanuel,  He explained that the humane disposition by the governor was an indication that, the leadership of the state has respect for constitutional offices, especially the office of the president. Nkanga condemned APC’s negative interpretation of the initial refusal, describing it as an indication of desperation anchored on selfish agenda. He expressed concern that the APC was unmindful of how much it would take the state government to fix the facilities that might be destroyed during the campaigns. The one time military governor of the state, said: “We wish to state unequivocally that the PDP and indeed the good people of Akwa Ibom State are united in a common determination not to mortgage the soul of state for pittance.“It is also worthy to note that the decision is a clear indication of the huge sense of maturity and exemplary statesmanship by the governor.” The director general expressed concern that some of the key protagonists of APC today, had while in power, displayed a clear lack of tact and class.“One incident that most Akwa Ibom people would not forget in a hurry is the deliberate denial of ex-governor Victor Attah the use of Ibom Hotels and Resort to mark his 70th birthday. “Gratefully, history offered the state an opportunity to right the wrong, when the current government in the state, not only approved the use of the facility for Attah’s 80th birthday, but also bank-rolled the event,” he said. Nkanga flayed the APC double face action, noting: “At the national level, we are all living witnesses to the blatant refusal by management of the Eagle Square in Abuja to grant a former PDP Presidential aspirant, the use of the facility.” The director general added that in contrast, it is on record that the Akwa Ibom State government has at several times, granted APC the use of Uyo Township Stadium even when it wasn’t the most convenient thing to do.
