The phenomenal show Game of Thrones which created a language of its own, according to a reveal by one of its stars was shrouded in secrecy as the producers were afraid of a leak. Ian Glenn who plays Ser Jorah Mormont revealed that the producers were paranoid about any leaks that they were not allowed to write down anything on paper. They had to use passworded Ipads with passwords being changed often to ensure there won’t be reveals and spoilers. In an interview with BBC, he said, “Everything was accessed through iPads with different security you had to get through to access it. Which caused a problem for the actors, I have to say.” From all the interviews granted by the actors from the hit series, they say the final season will be more epic than all the previous yet nobody knows exactly the outcome and who will be saved from the impending great war that everyone is anticipating in the final season.

He added that “This season was the first ever that we sat and read the entire arc of the story from beginning to end right through over the course of a day.” He described the six final episodes as ‘absolutely phenomenal’ and that it drew tears from the actors because it was the final and the time for farewell. According to announcements, the final season will be released in April 2019.
