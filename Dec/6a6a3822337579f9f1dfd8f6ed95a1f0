A member of the House of Representatives, Johnson Agbonayinma, ‎representing Egor/Ikpoba-Okha Federal Constituency, Edo State, said on Tuesday that some members ‎were already gathering signatures to impeach Vice president Yemi Osinbajo. Agbonayinma, who made the allegation while addressing journalists in Abuja Tuesday, said: “the reason is that of the NEMA investigation.” The House had probed the activities of the National Emergency Management Agency in the North-East, during which it indicted Osinbajo and the Director-General of the agency. The House of Representatives ad-hoc Committee on Emergency and Disaster Preparedness on November 13 offered insight into why it indicted Vice president on the alleged diversion of N5.8 billion meant for emergency intervention in the Northeast. “Yes, of course, he (Osinbajo) does have questions to answer. He may have questions to answer because he is the chairman of the governing council of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and he was the acting president that gave the approval,” the Chairman of the committee,  Ali Isa said. To justify his position, he brandished a memo (reference number SH/OVP/DCOS/HMF/010), dated June 1, 2017, which drew the attention of the former finance minister, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, to an approval for the purchase of 30,905,08 metric tonnes of grains worth N5,036,644,933.26 and the cost for logistics and distribution of the grains put at N829,026,456. Agbonayinma,‎ however, refused to name‎ the lawmakers behind the campaign against the Vice president, saying they include aggrieved members of the ruling All Progressives Congress.
