Nigeria’s state for environment minister Ibrahim Usman Jibrin has resigned his position after emerging Emir of Nasarawa. He tendered his resignation on Wednesday at the ongoing Federal Executive Council, which was presided over by president Muhammadu Buhari. A valedictory session was thereafter held for him. Jibrin was appointed Emir of Nasarawa on Saturday, December 8. Buhari described the new traditional ruler as a “wise choice and worthy successor” saying Jibrin’s credentials as a public servant and land expert will be deployed to impact positively on the development of his emirate. “His people will benefit immensely from his wealth of experience in the Ministry of Environment,” Buhari said in a congratulatory message. Jibrin was appointed as the Minister of State for Environment in December 2015 after confirmation by Nigerian Senate.
