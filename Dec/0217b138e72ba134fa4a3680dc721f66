National chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole has prayed that ‘God Almighty will not allow People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) return to power in 2019 for looting the nation dry’ during its 16 years in power. Oshiomhole believes that PDP’s return to power would hinder the country’s ‘progress’. Now an opposition party, PDP ruled Nigeria from 1999 to 2015, when the then opposition coalition championed by the All Progressives Congress defeated the party at the polls. Oshiomhole, who spoke in Lafia, at the inauguration of the APC 2019 statewide campaign and presentation of flags to candidates, said only President Muhammadu Buhari can salvage the country and bring it back to prosperity. He explained that God healed the President from sickness to shame the PDP, who wished him dead, adding that Buhari would win the 2019 general elections with relative ease. Oshiomhole urged the people of Nasarawa State to vote massively for Buhari and other APC candidates in the 2019 general elections. While commending current Nasarawa State Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura, he urged the APC governorship candidate Abdullahi Sule to continue where Al-Makura stopped when elected. Al-Makura urged the people to ensure Buhari’s re-election in 2019 as well as other APC candidates. He said the President has done a lot for the state by providing 33kva electricity and award of contract for the dualisation of Keffi, Makurdi, Abuja road among many other achievements. The governorship candidate, Sule, assured the people that he would use his experience in the private sector to bring growth to the state. He promised the residents that he would take the state to the next level, adding that he has the template to drive the state to grow.
