According to the Chairman of Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Abdulaziz Yari, the President informed the governors that “the economy is in bad shape and that we have to come together, think and rethink on the way forward.” Yari, who is the governor of Zamfara State, and his colleagues, met with Buhari at the Presidential Villa after the National Economic Council meeting, which took place on Friday. Although the agenda of the meeting was not communicated to newsmen, however, it may be unconnected to the fight for a national minimum wage by the country’s Labour unions The forum, through its spokesperson Abduralzaque Bello Barkindo, after its meeting, promised to resolve the national minimum wage imbroglio with Buhari before the year winds up. Labour unions had charged the President to take urgent steps to address the lingering issue on the new national minimum wage by immediately forwarding an executive bill to the National Assembly to legalise the tripartite committee’s recommendations. The tripartite committee, set up by the President, to review the N18000 minimum wage had recommended N30,000 as new minimum pay.
