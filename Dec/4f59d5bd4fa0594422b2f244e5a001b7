Can anything good come out of Nazareth? This Biblical saying is often applied when talking about Nigeria and her contribution to the world economy. This is because excelling in a ravaged environment that threatens to stall the talent of her people takes wit, determination and aspirations. In this regard, Nigerians have continued to ride on strides that not only defy this application but makes her people rank among the trendsetters in modern times. As 2018 slowly draws a close, we take a walk down memory lane at the year which has been an eventful one.
Drawn from across different occupations ranging from Sports, Film, Music, Technology, Agriculture, Art, Public Service, Guardian Life lists 11 super achievers who embody the hopes and aspiration of many. Their success in their various endeavours stand them apart from not only locally but quite a number of them have also been able to imprint themselves on the global scene. To arrive at this list, Guardian Life used indicators such as the impact of their achievement to the development of society, the role they played in putting Nigeria on the spotlight in 2018 and their continued relevance in the society. Chidera Muoka, Guardian Life’s editor, said “Over the past few years, we have witnessed a revolution in different sectors of the world’s economy and we are delighted that some Nigerians have contributed towards this revolution. This is why Guardian Life is recognising individuals who have made an impact across continents.”
