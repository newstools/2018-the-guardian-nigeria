WeStan A Queen! Beyonce once again showed us why she is the queen. At the Global Citizen: Mandela 100 festival which held in Johannesburg, South Africa, she did not just sing, she rapped. She and her husband performed some of their songs from the On The Run II tour. The highlight was when Bey rapped her verses on the Apeshit single. Beyoncé… it’s not even fair… pic.twitter.com/P40kyFJphT — Vince Valholla (@VinceValholla) December 2, 2018  Beyonce wrote a letter to Mandela stating, “Your kindness and gratitude for every experience, and your ability to forgive are lessons I have learned and will pass on to my three children. My entire family holds you in high regard.”
