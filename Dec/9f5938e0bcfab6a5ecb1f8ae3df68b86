Chief Press Secretary to Chairman of the commission, Rotimi Lawrence, who confirmed the development, told The Guardian yesterday that all eligible voters will be accredited by Smart Card Readers (SCRs). There has being anxiety among some political parties, stakeholders in the electoral process and the electorate over President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to sign the new electoral act as amended by the National Assembly. Some stakeholders have also expressed fear that with the President’s refusal to sign the amended electoral act, the election will be skewed in favour of the All Progressive Congress (APC). Reacting to the development, the Good Governance Initiative (GGI) yesterday flayed the presidency for attempting to truncate the nation’s democracy by refusing to sign the new electoral act, and urged the international community to intervene and save the nation’s democracy. Its President, Nnosike Nwosu told The Guardian in Abuja that President Buhari hated the rule of law, urging the National Assembly to veto the President on the electoral law. “We cannot continue like this as a people. We suffered for this democracy so much as not to allow an anti-democrat like Buhari to return to power by the jackboot,” he said. Nwosu said the latest development has brought INEC to ridicule wondering how the commission would conduct an acceptable election when it is glaringly acting the President’s script. Rotimi added that INEC will no longer use incident forms during the polls, stressing that the SCRs will accredit all Nigerians for the elections.
