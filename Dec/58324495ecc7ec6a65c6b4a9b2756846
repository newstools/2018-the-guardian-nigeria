Photo/Twitter/GOVONDO  The Guardian gathered that Mrs. Oluwatoyin Abiodun, Mr. Ojo Ayodeji, Mr. David Omoyajowo, Mr. Isaac Solomon and Mr. Femi Tuki allegedly diverted the public fund to their private purses. They were paraded yesterday at the state police command with Mr. Ayadi Orimisan, who allegedly aided them to perpetrate the crime. While parading the suspects, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Femi Joseph, disclosed that they were issuing fake tax clearance, certificate of road-worthiness and fake driver’s licence. Joseph, who noted that the police had begun investigation into the matter, added that the suspects would be charged to court at the conclusion of investigations. According to the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Special Duties, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, interim investigation shows that the state government has been defrauded to the tune of N200 million. Odebowale revealed that the investigation indicted the civil servants, leading to their arrest and subsequent handing over to the police for prosecution. Mrs. Abiodun, who confirmed that they had been suspended by the state’s civil service commission, denied the allegation. Arguing that the government lied against them, she said that all the monies made in their different agencies and ministries were remitted to the state.
