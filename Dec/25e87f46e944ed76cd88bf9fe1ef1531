Legacy Debt Fund, a N1.96 billion mutual fund managed by First City Asset Management Limited (FCAM), has had its credit quality risk rating upgraded by one notch, from A(f) to A+(f), by Agusto & Co, the foremost pan-African rating agency.
 
The Fund, which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was also assigned a fund volatility rating of FV3, a higher ratings that indicate low to moderate exposure to downside risk in the medium term. 
 
FCAM, a subsidiary of FCMB Group Plc, had the ratings assigned to its Fund based on Fund Credit Quality Rating, which is an evaluation of the degree of protection an investor has against losses arising from credit risk, and Fund Volatility Rating, as well as the Fund’s exposure to downside risk arising from changes in market conditions.
 
The “A+(f)” credit quality rating reflects the Fund’s minimal exposure to downside risk arising from credit defaults, while the “FV3” volatility rating indicates the Fund’s moderate sensitivity to changing market conditions. 
 
According to Agusto & Co, “the upgrade in the credit quality rating of Legacy Debt Fund is based on the Fund’s consistent practice of allocating more than 75% of the net assets in FGN securities.” 
 
Other reasons given by Agusto & Co for the Fund’s new ratings are investment in good quality assets, low exposure to liquidity risk, and moderate exposure to interest rate risk.
 
The rest include no currency risk exposure, robust investment processes, and an investment team with adequate expertise, with its portfolio manager possessing over 19 years of experience.
 
The Chief Executive Officer of FCAM, James Ilori, said the fund has been upgraded by three notches, in the last one year, expressing gratitude to the rating agency for recognising the consistency, professionalism and hardwork, put in the management of Legacy Debt Fund.
 
“In addition, we thank investors in the Fund, for trusting us to assist them in meeting their investment goals. Our team of internationally trained investment professionals will continue to manage the Fund conservatively, whilst creating more value for unitholders, in line with the Fund’s Trust deed”.
