Same-sex relations are punishable under the law in Nigeria, but this did not deter two women who are suspected to be lesbians to plan a wedding in Kano state in Northern Nigeria. They have been reportedly arrested by the Islamic police force in Kano and will face indictment. Kano state adopted the Sharia law in 2000 and practices this law although it only applies to Muslims residing in the state. And according to the Hisbah, the planned wedding was judged to be immoral. The guests and the owner of the venue in which the wedding would have been held were arrested as well. The women had reportedly planned to hold in the Sabon Gari district and area where most residents are mostly non-muslim. The couple and their guests who were arrested will be charged according to Sharia Law. The federal law states that homosexual acts attract 14 years in prison and same-sex marriage and public display of affection by same-sex couples is also prohibited. However, since the introduction of the law, people suspected to be homosexual or gay have been arrested, publicly humiliated and even violently attacked.
