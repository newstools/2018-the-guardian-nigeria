While interfacing with aggrieved aspirants from the two states, Shettima commended Ambode on how he handled the outcome of the primary in Lagos, urging the aspirants to view life from that perspective. “Since 1999, Governor Ambode, who is also a member of this committee, I don’t think any Nigerian politician has demonstrated his level of courage in the way he handled the outcome governorship primaries in Lagos. “He is a governor who has worked exceptionally, but, as I said, politics sometimes comes with unpredictable outcomes. Our courage in reacting to situations like Governor Ambode is what separates men from boys. “I think anyone unhappy with the outcome of the APC primaries should draw inspiration from Governor Ambode,” he advised. Governor el-Rufai expressed joy that the crisis in Ekiti was not as huge and convoluted like that of Ondo, expressing fear that lack of unity might cost the party Ondo.
