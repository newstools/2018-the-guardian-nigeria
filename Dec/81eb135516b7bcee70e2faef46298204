Luka Modric was announced the 2018 Ballon d’Or winner ahead of five-time winners Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi on Monday. The Croatian capped a successful year with the award after he won the Champions League and was a finalist in the 2018 World Cup. Prior to the announcement, the diminutive midfielder had won the UEFA Player of the year award in August and The Best FIFA Men’s Player award in September. The list was dominated with players from the France World Cup-winning team while players from Real Madrid’s 2018 Champions League squad also featured heavily. Luka Modric ended Ronaldo’s and Messi’s hegemony on the award on the night, as neither of them got what would have been a sixth Ballon d’Or. Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus in the summer, placed second while Barcelona’s Messi finished outside the podium at 5th place. Paris Saint Germain’s youngster, Kylian Mbappe, placed fourth to continue his rise to a fantastic year so far. Here’s how the top 30 players ranked in 2018. =29 Isco
