 [FILE PHOTO] Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu<br />  He was speaking while swearing in the new chief judge of the state, Justice Onuoha Ogwe, at the Government House, Umuahia. The governor said his administration was working to give Abians their due, reiterating that official vehicles would be provided for more judges. “I am aware that many courts in the state are in dilapidated conditions, hence something ought to be done in terms of providing conducive environment for judicial officers to operate. A state of emergency will be declared in courts, especially in Osisioma and Obingwa,” he pledged. The new chief judge, on his part, said that interaction among the arms of government would prevent possible suspicion and impact positively on the state. He noted that the judiciary had enjoyed a cordial relationship with the executive in the state. The CJ, whose appointment was recommended by the National Judicial Council (NJC) and endorsed by the House of Assembly, assured the governor that the judiciary under his watch would continue to live up to its constitutional responsibilities.
