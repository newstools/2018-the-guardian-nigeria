According to him, the All Progressive Congress (APC), led government in the state has fallen short of expectations of people in providing adequate security and jobs for the people. The governorship candidate assured the people of the zone that PDP would ensure that peace returned to the state if given the mandate.
Umbugadu said that as a seasoned lawmaker, he has all that was required to serve the good people of the state. “People are not happy with the government of the day especially in the areas of security, employment, am assuring you that peace will return to the state. “We will create jobs for our teeming youths, empower young entrepreneurs because PDP stands for security, it stands for job and wealth creation in order to improve the welfare of the people,” he said. While thanking his supporters from across the three senatorial zones, he expressed optimism that the PDP would win in the next general election. Also speaking, the state PDP Chairman, Mr Francis Orogu said the party deliberately zoned the governorship position to Nasarawa North for political reasons. Orogu therefore appealed to the people to toe the part of Sen. Solomon Ewuga and other party men by supporting and voting PDP massively in the next election. The party chairman sued for calm to avoid distraction by political opponents, adding that the good people of the state had already chosen who would represent them in 2019.
