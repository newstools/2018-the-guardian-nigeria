 [FILE] Governor Udom Gabriel Emmanuel,  He restated that those making such comments could best be described as “empty vessels” making the loudest noise. He said this yesterday at the Ibom Hall Ground in Uyo, when over 20,000 units, wards and chapter officers of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and other parties defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Udom told the defectors that the PDP stood for peace and would not shed anyone’s blood in its quest for political power, assuring them that for taking the decision to join the PDP, their names would be written in gold. The governor, who expressed happiness over the development, commended the defectors for taking a bold decision to join the party, which he described as the only grassroots party in the country. He said their decision was not because of him, nor the party chairman or any other person, but for the soul of Akwa Ibom and urged them to stand up in defence of the state at all times. “Today, it is a thing of joy that over 20,000 have come to over to the PDP. This is unprecedented in the history of our state.” “What you are doing today is not about me, it is not about the party chairman, or any other person, but about the soul of Akwa Ibom State,” he stated. Speaking, Chairman of the party, Paul Ekpo, described the number of the defectors as unprecedented in the history of the party, adding that he was shocked that its message of industrialisation, peace, stability and workability has touched the minds of those who have decided to join the PDP.
