“Hellboy” is the reboot of the film series of the same name which was first released in 2004. The first “Hellboy” made in 2004 was a Superhero film in which a demonic beast turned into a superhero and secretly worked to save the world from supernatural threats. He had support from a team, the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. The film was directed by Guillermo del Toro starring Ron Perlman as Hellboy. It was based on a graphic novel Hellboy: Seed of Destruction by Mike Mignola. The 2019 reboot, however, is still based on the Dark Horse Comics character of the same name and this time directed by Neil Marshall and stars David Harbour as the lead “Hellboy”. This time the beast superhero races to save the world from an ancient medieval sorceress who plans to end the world. The film features Milla Jovovich, Ian MacShane, Sasha Lane and Daniel Dae Kim. Hellboy 2019 is the third instalment of the film series and did not see the feature of the original “Hellboy” played by Ron Perlman as he refused to feature without the directional guidance of Guillermo del Toro. The 2004 version although received well by critics was not such a hit in the box office. With this reboot and sophisticated visuals, let’s hope it shatters box office records. The film is set to be released in April 2019. See the trailer below: http:///www.youtube.com/watch?v=khUpyzsvUiA
