Say church remains apolitical
The Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has warned Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka to desist from using the Catholic liturgical ceremonies for political campaigns. They said the warning became imperative following the shameful scenario, which played out at the Adoration Centre ground between Mbaka and Peter Obi, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vice presidential candidate, in Enugu. Secretary-General of CBCN, Rev. Fr. Ralph Madu, who spoke yesterday in Abuja at a briefing, reiterated that no Catholic priest or people of consecrated life should be actively involved in partisan politics in obedience to the Canon Law of the church. He said: “The bishops condemn in totality the shameful scenario on an adoration ground as contained in the video recording that has gone virile on the social media and say without reservation that the reported incident does not have the support of Bishops Conference of Nigeria.” “Our concern is for a peaceful election process seen to be free, fair, credible and just, and a democratic governance that guarantees peace, justice, equity, development and religious freedom for the common good.” He, therefore, urged all priests and religion faithful to keep the position of the church on the issue of non-partisan politics as  campaigns of political parties have started gathering momentum.
